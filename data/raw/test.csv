000d118,"Many people have car where they live. The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen like you can get in accidet or the smoke that the car has is bad to breath on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely ""car free"" but If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called ""smart planning"". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that ""All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change"" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called ""car reduced""communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.    ",3
000fe60,"I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the ""face"" on mars. I will be explaining how the ""face"" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.

First off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.

Next, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?

Finaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the ""face"" is just a landform.

To sum all this up the ""face"" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.",3
001ab80,"People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.

Currently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely ""driverless"". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the ""driverless"" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely ""driverless"". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more ""fun"", driving is not meant to be ""fun"" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have ""fun"" is just a recipe for disaster.

The idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.

The technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         ",4
001bdc0,"We all heard about Venus, the planet without almost oxygen with earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit but what if scientist project the futur into this planet ? Through this article, the author uses evidences appealing to reason and concession to make us realize why we should care about studying this planet so that people must give a chance to Venus.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size but has a really different climate. As it is evoked by the author:

( 3) ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit....Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" The author uses of concession tell us what is the actual climate of Venus. He tell us the truth, he support the fact that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit but he also recognize that there's a danger present continuously. And because he support the idea of studying Venus, he proposes ways to study the planet and find a solution at a reasonable distance.

Venus is an inhospitable planet that can almost be considered as an impossible dwelling for humans. But for the author, that can't keep scientist to do their job (studying Venus) : (5) ""NASA’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Through this evidence, appealing to reasonning, the author talk about the NASA's possible solution to raise his credibility. But also, to convince the audience that we can only find a solution by studying the planet.

In conclusion, despite of Venus hostility put in advance by the concession, the author makes the audience realize that there's a solution but that we can find it only if we study the planet. He make us find out that challenge and curiosity is part of human life. But also that danger and fear should not stop us from discovering new things. After all, we are Humans.",4
002ba53,"Dear, State Senator

This is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.""There are many reasons to keep the Electoral College"" one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College because,it is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).

Another, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Last but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.

0030e86,"If I were to choose between keeping the electoral college or abolishing it, I would chose for abolishing it. The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen's votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabaotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.

I propose abolishing the electoral college and replacing it with a simpler system that appeals to all united states citizens instead of just certain citizens. Based on phrases in the passage, there is evidence that the electoral college system is corrupt. An example would be:

Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

-source 2, second paragraph.

This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.

Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.

You may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.

I propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated. This would be a less confusing system that could make voting more efficient.            ",4
0033037,"The posibilty of a face reconizing computer would be very helpful for children or even adults. Its would be helpful in a ways of satifying our needs and why showing us thing that would make going on the internet better.

I think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says "" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"". And if the students is ""confused and bored"" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.

In my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what her/she is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.",2
0033bf4,"What is the Seagoing Cowboys progam?

It was to help many countries that had been scarred by World War II.

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them.

People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRRA.

People should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys progam, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work.

It makes you feel good about yourself.

The article says, "" It made me more aware other countries and their needs.""

That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries.

Wouldn't that make you feel good?

In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going.

You could see Italy and other countries.

The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

That would be very exciting.

How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working?

You wouldn't have to pay for travel

While working for this program, you would also have fun.

The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals.

The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also the article even states that they played games.

Even though you are working, you will still have fun.

So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many different parts of the world.

Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

They helped many countries in Europe.

The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals.

So, do you think that you would want to become a Seagoing Cowboy?

Or at least be in the program.  ",3

You'd be helping our country because when Luke was in seagoing cowboy program it was 1945 and world war 2 was happening in Europe and he had to those countries recover. Luke had to help the horses when the war was over to get people places and to work. If you were 18 or up you might be lucky and be drafted into the military service. The UNRRA would hire seagoing Cowboys to feed the horses cows and mules that were shipped overseas.

You'd be traveling around they world like Luke did. It took Luke 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast. You'd be traveling to China, Europe, Greece, and many more places. The only way you'd be good at this job is if you wouldn't get sea sick because if you are a seagoing cowboy told travel overseas a lot.

First how would these computers like programs know when to go or turn at a stop light? This could create many dangers and conflicts on the road. Next how could these computers detect humans? If the car doesn't know a person is j walking it could run over the person and possibly kill them, and yes j walking is illegal but it still happens. Finally i don't think these computers are a good idea because of malfunction. If something goes wrong in the car or the brakes go out it can lead to death for the passenger.

005a72e,"I agree that driverless cars are a developing idea. I do like the fact that these cars should be used by the public. They could lead us to a whole other revolutionary idea with the way the human race lives our lives. It could help us all out with our neccessaties. Also it could help us with other sciences in our lives such as medical assisstants and drivers. Next, the ability to drive without a driver could help us alll in the aspect of the way on how we live our lives.

First, for example in the text paragraph 7 it says how the company of BMW has made the ""Trafiic Jam Assisstant"" which could help us drive up to 25 mph without the need to do anything at all. Driverless cars dont just help us at drving it helps us at being smarter. The science put into these cars to drive without any work is fascinating. If we could put that same science in other fields justy as medical, then the possibilites are endless. We could have assisstant doctors getting us tools that we need,when we need them, and alarming us when something is wrong.

Next, these cars are fantastic for elderly people who are unable to drive by themselves. They offer a sugnificant amount of assisstants for them so they dont have to rely on anyone else. Next, it could help keep us safe in our cars. For example, in the article in paragraph 7 it also states that these new cars have developed a drivers seat that ""vibrates"" when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. These cars can reduce the amount of vehicle incidents very much. Not only can they stop us from backing in to something but they can also stop us from being killed.

After that, they have video cameras also in every corner of the car to help the driver sense any danger around them. For Instance, in parapraph 4 they tell of how they have a ""spinning sensor on the roof that uses laser beams to form a constantly updated 3-d model of the car and it's surrounding. They need all of these so it could act as if a human being was in the driver's seat. Further more, these ""newer cars"" dont just give us new abilities, but also the new knowledge. They show us what needs improvement and what doesn't. Also, they help us guide our way to safety if we are lost.

To inculde, these cars could also lead us to anywhere we need. This is very important in case someone gets lost. For example, if someone is lost on a camping trip and is in the wrong spot there and needs assisstance, then there car could lead then to safety and tell them exactly where they are located. It could also serve as a discovery unit. For instance, if someone is in a new town or city then they need to know where the gas station, hotel, restaurant, etc are and there car would take them there. They would help them navigate to whereever there destination might be.

In conclusion, the need for cars that do not need a driver is very important to our everyday lives. They would help navigate, save, and make our lives easier. They would help our economy out tremendoulsy by reducing accidents and the death rate. Next, they would help with people who need it such as elderly and disabled people. Last, these cars are getting closer and closer to becoming a part of our daily lives already, because we have the science that helped us develop these types of cars now.",4
00613e3,"The election should be by popular vote of the citizens not by government hired official with some group name to make them sound important.

The electoral colledge is just a way for the people running for president to get votes that they do not deserve. There are 538 electors in the electoral colledge and that means that that is 538 votes that may or may not have gone in favor of the person that the people wanted for president. Out of the 538 elecors they only need 270 votes to elect a president. Why not let the people (who go through tougher times than government officials) get the votes to elect the president. Each candidate that is running for president has their own group of electors who would rather vote for their candidate so they can get a big fat paycheck, instead of actually sitting down and trying to decide who is the most qualified to run this country. There are others who think like me too, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election instead of having suck up electors who don't even think about the people of the country. They do what they do best. Do you wnt to know what it is? They are suck ups for the candidate from their state (or to whomever has the most money).

There are some people who are going to say that the electoral colledge is a good way to elect our president and I understand that.

The electoral colledge might be a good thing because it consists of qualified government hired officials instead of everyday commoners like us. The electoral colledge was put into the Constitution so it must be worth something. Every state has their own candidate and with him are his electors, the best politicians that the government could hire for this job from that state. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the president and some people might be like HEY!, that is 270 votes that we dont have to do. The electoral colledge might also be a good thing for people who don't care about who runs the country.

If this country was founded on freedom, don't we have the freedom, no, don't we have the right to vote for who runs this country. Not suck up politicians. We should vote for our President!     ",3
0065bd6,"Driverless cars should not exsist it can cause many accidents and possibly can result into death. I believe that driverless cars should not exsist because it can be dangerous to not just one person but for everyone.

Lets say you have a driverless car and sensors stopped working and you didn't know that, right there can cause a huge accident, just because the sensors stopped working.Or lets say you do get into an accident driving a driverless car who's fault would it be? We don't know. The text states in paragraph 9, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture?"" People need to know who's fault it would be if they are driving a driverless car and get into an accident and possibly get injured.

There is no point of having a driverless car if it is not completely driverless. In paragraph 7 it states that, ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" It also states that, ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" What if the person using the driverless car isn't paying attention to the notification sign, or what if a person falls asleep and didn't hear the notification sign then what?

In paragraph 9 it states, ""Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" I completely agree with that statement because with a driverless car what if it loses control you won't be able to do anything about it because you are not in control of it, but with a person driving,

that person has100% control of what ever happens.          ",3
0066c7c,"My position on driveless cars are bad because i don't trust them. I have a couple reasons why i don't trust them. My first reason is accidents. Driveless cars could have a sytem malfunction and drive off course and something breaks and crash into somthing. This could happen to anyone such as police, buses, and simple pedestrians.

My second reason is too many driveless cars. If there were to make way too many drivless cars then it would alot of traffic because there are alot of cars who need a driver to drive. Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.

My last reason is pollution. If aot of people bought all these driveless cars then so much pollution would comeup and take over the sky and people would get sick and die from breathing in the air. If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.

006c931,"What if we could tell how all of the people us were without even asking. Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truely feeling. What then? Well new techonlogy can allow us to see exctly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secert.

The computer software works by making a 3-D computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technolgy delevopted by Dr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Dr. Huang obseres that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I htought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Dr Hoang also states that ""even though individuals often show verying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. or even why the are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benfits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Dr Huang was able to develope a computer that uses muscle movment to idenitfy emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepare and willing to ask why? ",3
006d0e1,"Have you ever seen Europe? What about China, or the Acropolis in Greece? Have you seen Venice, Italy, or the Panama Canal? If you've ever wanted to do those things, and help a lot of people while doing it, you're Seagoing Cowboy material. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of the hard work it teaches, the experience, and because you're supporting other countries, as well as your own!

First of all, we have the grueling hard work to speak of. Some may say that grueling hard work is not a reason to volunteer for something, but I disagree. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is nothing like a normal, boring life. Yes, you have hard work, but you get the greatest sense of satisfaction once you're done. You get to know that all your hard work has gone to helping people in need, and that you've really made a mark on this world. I think hard work is also the path to knowledge, and you may just learn some life lessons along the way.

Secondly, the fantastic experience is what we will cover. Some people may argue that the experience isn't worth risking your life over, but in reality, it's quite the contrary. If you're a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel the world, like I mentioned. You can see places like Greece, Italy, and China. Also, don't forget their unforgetable landmarks that you will see! Not only do you get to travel the world, but this is a once in a lifetime experience! We won't be around forever! Plus, I bet it will make one heck of a story to tell your grandchildren, am I right?

Finally, we have the service you are providing. Some may say you are better off in the military. This may be so, but would you rather be taking lives, or saving them? Plus, us Seagoing Cowboys were only created because of World War II to clean up the mess. Wouldn't it be counterproductive to start a World War III? Here, you get to help people, improve lives, and do good for your country, and the country you're in. I think that with more of us Seagoing Cowboys, we can make the world a better place.

Us Seagoing Cowboys know how to work hard, experienced a once in a lifetime chance, and supported our and many other countries. We've seen Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and even Panama! We've traveled the world, crossing oceans to and fro, for the good of mankind. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up today!",4
0072128,"Imagine a world without garages, gastations, or parkinglots. The problem with today's world is our lives revovle around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many.  The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the enviorment and in the communities.  For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars compltely (Rosenthal).  On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smog-only odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day (Duffer).  Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air poplution from tailpipes, congestion lessened, and indroduced alternative ways of transportaion into differnet communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States"" (Rosenthal).  This means if car usauge was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our polution in the United States.  ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" (Rosenthal).  The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S.  Without so much air polution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives.  We would be able to ruduce global warmimg if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns.  ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Duffer). This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be.  In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be (Selsky).  With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only  benefit the enviorment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America.  Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement.  So the next time you get in the car and buckle your seatbelt think about the advantages that could come from not driving today.         ",4
0079938,"I don't like the idea of driveless cars. I feel like if a human can do it we should. Especially when it comes to things like that. like the idea of robots, would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care of older folks and children. I do think they are a good idea for the blind and people not going to far. Like since i live in Indiana, they would be a good idea for people in Indianapolis to get from the mall to like a resturant or something. Nothing major or far like driving from Indiana to California, not a good idea. I just don't trust things like that.

Driveless cars are sort of a good idea. they're are many pros and cons about the whole thing. I feel like they are dangerous because they could malfuncting and blow up or something. Or they will drive right into a buliding at full speed or something. No car is really safe in general, but letting a robot like thing drive your car is kinda a crazy idea. Another con is that they can't really drive by itself, it still needs you to hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident ot people working on roads. I feel like if they want to have driving cars they should just bulid a car that can drive people instead of a car that half does it. Another con is that they are basically illlegal in most states except a couple. Would we have to visit somewhere else to expericence what crazy technology the world has for us now. I also think they are a bad idea because driving are probably going to be directly on their phone, no hand on the steering wheel or anything. And like it says, when the car needs you to take over it will tell you to take over. But i feel like people will just ignore it and get into accidents they could have prevented.

Pros are that you can half drive. You wouldn't have to really pay attention to anything around you and you could just relax while driving. ",3

Also whats possibly on Also whats possibly on Mars, how each planet orbits at different speeds. NASA has sent many people into space to see what its like. Too see if we could have life on Venus and how each planet orbits at different speeds.

Venus is unlikely to live on because it has 97% carbon dioixde blankets. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in acid in Venu's atmosphere.

Even though we would like to put people on Venus its just to likely that someone could die from the atmosphere.

0081f18,"i think that having self driving cars would help alot. there are so many wreacks in the states because some people just dont know how to drive right.

so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind.

there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned.

although we would also have to make some new laws or change a few of them. like in the text it states that what if somone gets in a wreak in a smart car should the driver be blamed or the companies that sold the the car to that person beheld responcibale. there also still some improvements that have to be made before they can even start selling those cars .

those are the main reasons that i think making smarter cars is a great idea.",3

I highly encourage you to join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Think of how sad you would be if you were devestated by the war and had barely anything left.

Wouldn't you want someone to help bring you supplies such as animals?

Well you can be one of the few people to contibute.

The families over seas are all very kind and appriciative.

Though they are still very much in need.

So, you would just be helping the cause by joining.

Over the past year, me and my friend, Don Reist, have had the opportunity to see historical landmarks.

The chance to just see Europe and China would have been special.

But Don and I got to expirience so much more than that.

We got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Also, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, was a treat.

I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Come on.

Don't tell me you wouldn't love to have the opportunity to see the Panama Canal!

All you have to do is join the Seagoing Cowboys.

As you can clearly tell, being a Seagoing Cowboy is truly a great expirience.

We get to help those in need, and also have the chance to see historic landmarks around the world.

I hope that soon, you will decide to be like Don and I and join the UNRRA and become a Seagoing Cowboy.",3
0084f6c,"What exactly is the facial action coding system? Well it enables computers to identify human emotions and expressions. This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.

The worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it stated that ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc."" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.

Facial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor."" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.

By being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.

In the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.                                                   ",4

0098ef4,"Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.

In the article, 'Car-Free Cities' it talks a lot about the advantanges of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage ""Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occaional distant motor."" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says ""Passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usages, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life."" Moreover, in the passage it also says ""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" Furthermore, ""In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway."" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.

By limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Moreover, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicylce paths."" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;"" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.    ",4

Speaking of emotions, the Facial Action Coding System would be able to prevent students from getting too angry or too stressed. If a student is showing strong negative emotions, the FACS could notify someone or tell the student to take a break.

Many students hide their negative emotions in a classroom, for fear of looking bad amongst their peers. The FACS could help students, by acknowleding their emotions and change the lesson or the atmosphere.

All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.

When having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.

On these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.

People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.

Becuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",4

If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be. If a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time.

Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more.

Theoretically thinking, a driverless vehicle could potentially cause a lot less trouble than a vehicle with a human driver. Sometimes, humans don't tend to make the best choices ever.

Many people also die just because some idiot decided they didn't need to pay attention, that text was just too important or than phone call may have been too important. More important than someones life of course. With driverless cars they would not have to worry about any of that, as long as they knew where they were going the car would get them there and back safely.

What's even better than a car you don't have to worry about driving? A car you don't have to worry about driving, while saving gas. According to the text, Mr Sergey Brin forsees cars that would use half the fuel that taxis use in todays world. Even if it wasnt much, if you add up everyone that rides taxis it accumulates and eventually everyones contributing to the problem. So a car that could use only half of the gas we use today, like is there any reason to say no to these cars?

Many people almost never get anywhere on time, some may have too much going on some might just not care. Whatever the case may be, what if these driverless cars could get you wherever you needed to be in the quickest way possible while not breaking the law. The driverless car could get you where you need to get by taking the quickest route possible. With all the advanced technology being promised the car could know whats ahead of it and if it will slow your trip down. For example if the car knows that up ahead is construction zone where you would have to slow down and waste time, it could just take a more efficient way and eventually save you time.

Driverless cars, hopefully soon, will no longer be a thing of the past. With technology just advancing without stopping i think soon driverless cars would just be another normal vehicle you see on the road. To me driverless cars would be an astounding idea. ",4
00b3311,"Did you know that Venus was maybe once like earth? And also maybe know that ""Mechanical Computers"" were used back in World War II that NASA may get ther idea for a invention to study Venus ? Sounds shocking right, well let me tell how and why these two questions may sound odd, but intresting.

NASA has been working on finding ways to study Venus. They have simplified electronicsthat are made of ""silicon carbide"" that have been tested in a chamber that is like Venus's surface, and has lasted for about 3 weeks in the comditons as Venus's surface. They still are working on other inventions that will allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully knowledge of Venus. NASA has also wanted a ship to orbit and hover safely far above the planet so that it can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of photography and videography of Venus. Astronomers have wanted to return to Venus but they wasnt a mission safe and scientifically productive. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believe in the solar sytem long ago Venus was like was just like Earth at one point. They also believe that Venus once had the features like eath like an ocean, mountains, valleys, and craters. In Venusian geology and weather present erupting volcanoes and frquent lighting , and maybe even strikes on the land surfaces. Venus atomosphere is about 97 percent of carbon dioxide and has a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Its temaptures are an average over 800 degrees , its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather that we experience on our own planet. Each pervious mission was unmanned and maybe thats a good reason no spacecraft survived the landing, or ecplains why not a single spaceship hs touched down on Venus in more than three decases. And is why Astonomers have also wanted a safe mission to go to Venus. And it is also why its a challenging planet for humans to study,which is like is said before why NASA has been wantiing to find good ways to study Venus. Another project taking us back to old technology us ""Mechanical Computers"". These computures were used in World War II,and these devices were used to make calculations andby using gears and levers and it did not require elctronic at al. Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicate when it came to physical conditons. systens that use nechanical parts can be made mire resistabt to pressure, heat a and other forces.

So Venus is a worthy, despite of the dangers and earth abd beyind should not be limited by daners abd doubts because uou shoild be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginatio and innovation. Meeting the challenge to study Venus has value but not because its interesting but because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimitdating endevaours.                        ",4
00bee4c,"Through out the world a lot of people are excited about the driverless cars that are being developed. However some of them fail to realize the negativities that come with this package. Not having to drive 24/7 would be nice, but at what price? Vehicles are not exactly the most reliable resource.

While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. They will go about thinking that the technology has everything under control. Forgetting that cars that require drivers have difficulties. Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building!

When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert.

Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own brain that allowes them to make the wrong or the right decission based on what they believe. Will you allow yourself to fall victim to awe or amazement and wonder at these new inventions. Or will you go over teh pro's and cons of becoming too reliant on the driverless vehicle and less aware of your actions while on the road? ",3
00c3589,"Exploration is key to a humans curiosity.Many people will indeed be anxious to explore something that is said to be impossible or dangerous because of curiosity.""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a prime example. In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.

One reason why the author of this article supports his ideas well is because he used statistics or in other words he used pathos.In paragraph five, he said""...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""He mentioned the idea of NASA creating a ""blimp-like"" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then he went on and entered his counterclaim by saying""...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,""therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.

Secondly,he states some facts about Venus itself.He added that ""...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also he siad that""...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.

Last but not least,in his conclusion he built a strong conclusion by mentionding in his opinion that""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation."" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.

In conclusion, the author supported his ideas well in the article. He supported his idead with statistics from NASA theirselves and he gave facts about Venus. He also included his counterclaims. Over all he gave a well informend and structures article.   ",4
00cb5dc,"In the passage ""The Challenge if Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that the studying of Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers it presents by explaining the fact that scientist can not of study if that Venus is like Earth because it is studied from a far distance and that they need to get closer and get rock samples. For example the passage states ,"" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientits seeking to conduct a thorough mission to nderstand Venus would need to get close up and pesonal dispite the risks."" This piece of evidence proves that they would have to go through with a mission to Venus to get rock, gas, and other samples for scientists to study to compare Venus to earth. Therfore, in the passage "" The Challenge of

Eploring Venus"" the authors suggestion to study Venus should entirely be accepted with the evidence they provided but also dispite the risks so that we have stand point on how close Venus is to the Earth comparing rocks,gases, and other pieces of evidence.",2
00ccc2d,"Space travel is something we people of Earth have just only begun to tinker with. Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

The planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater..."" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author stated that ""Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Shortly after this, they also stated that ""Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.

The author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors."" They also say in the next sentence ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.

The exploration of Venus is indeed a difficult and dangerous task, but in the end would be worth while. By advancing our technologies we can bypass the dangers of Venus and pave the road to move onto even more dangerous and difficult tasks, both on out planet and outside our planet. We could gain the knowledge of how similar Earth and Venus are, finalizing if it could have or did support life at one point in time. And the factors making Venus so dangerous, would be minimalized and surpassed. ",4
00d027f,"Imagine a system that can actually help you stay focused and determined with your learning. No more kids dozing off because of boredom, or becoming uninterested with a subject. This advancment in computer software that can recognize human emotions and change the way we learn for the better .

Now take the software mentioned into a class room where it can make ""calculations"" about human emotion just as any other human does. The author, Nick D'Alto, says this ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" he also quotes a Dr. Huang saying ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused or bored."" Take these two quotes and you imagine a super computer that can learn what you take interest in and modify it's self to your liking. This would allow students to take charge in how they learn a concept.

This could be the next big things in learning since computers were first introduced in a classroom. That's not even the limit. This technology could be implimented in home schooled children and online classes as well. The reason being as Dr. Huang puts it ""it could modify the lesson...like and effective human instructor."" This means it would have the power to change lessons if you were not following or just confused. This ability can amplify the process of students learning online or at home.

In coclussion the technology being able to recognize human emotions will only improve the educational system. Being able to tell if a student is bored or confused on a concept will help improve many aspects in schooling. Being able to modify lessons on the spot just like a human insturctor is valuable. ",3
00d4911,"To the senator of florida,

I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president (according to source 3), there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.    ",4
00d576b,"Well in my favor I would have the Electoral College reason why is because it keeps all the votes for the presidential election and etc. And each or any electors in your state has his or her own group of electors. And the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their responsibilities are. But the Electoral College it consists or has 538 electors but the majority is to have 270 s that you can vote for the president. By the way once you have voted for the president or senate or governer etc. The system will count how many popular votes or from a vote from Congress and the qualified citizens. But my reason for the electoral college to stay is that once you have voted you can count from the system or it does it for you but if you dont want the electoral college then it will take alot longer for the votes to be process and be accumilated.

Well so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, ""The electoral college  is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostky assertins withoout much basis in reality"". And its unfair cause it has the winner take all system in each state. And they sometimes have problems getting the votes from some states and they couldn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And the story says from someones opinion ""And the arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" And once a state has voten it  counts as 1 vote.

And some people and the people from the government or like congress,senators,representatives, and more hope that one day while they are voting that the score or number of votes is not a tie. But some citizens arn't into the technology of the electoral vote or how it works. But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational.

Since the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national elction, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible  American popluation did vote in 2012's election.                            ",1
00da297,"I think that the author is right about the idea of studying venus is worthly pursuit despite of the dangers NASA is working on studying venus. Why not study it it use to be like earth. and also it a star you see at night.

Venus is one of the most intresting planets near earth I think it would be intresting to study and so does NASA the text says, ""NASA is working on othe approaches to study Venus for example, some simplified electronics mode of silicon carbide have bee tested in a chamber simualting the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions"". See we could try and study Venus we could be on there for a 2 weeks and leave.

Venus is called the sister planet because of how close it is and like family Venus has the same looks aswhille the text says, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"". See if Venus is like earth we could look at what happened to it and make sure that doesn't happened to us.

Venus is a star we see at night have you ever wonder what it was? Or how it's like earth and has no life that is what NASA and so

many more space programs are trying to find out.

I think that the author is right that we should go study Venus even if it dangerus it's worthy of that risk. it a star and planet in our solar system. Venus is our sister planet and looks like us too, and NASA is finding ways for us to be able to walk on Venus and study it aswhile. ",3
00daaa2,"Pollution is one of the most dangerous causes in the world. However, people need the things that pollutes the air. Such as cars, body sprays,etc. I agree that the citizens should limit car usage.

Fuel is one of the causes that pollutes the air. According to the passage,""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" In addition to that, diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in france. Compared to a 53.3 percent average engines in the rest of western europe. Robert Duffer states that, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of global city."" Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Moreover, the same goes for odd-numbered plates. With that, the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party.

All the countries should try a car-free day. Andrew Selsky said, ""In a program that set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" Some of the advantages of having a car-free day can help make people see that its not about cars or bikes. Even so, Those things are just damaging the air and making it harder to live and breathe. Also stated in the article was that, "" It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by board, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Futhermore, it would help so people can see the world without cars and not pollute the air.

By giving some of the dangerous stuff that we use daily a break. We will see great turn outs and good things happen. Like, less traffic which means less accidents, less fuel used which means less pollution. Lets all help keep our country safe and clean. STOP POLLUTION! I firmly agree that citizens should limit car usage.    ",3
00dd003,"Using the Facial Action Coding System is not necessary whatsoever. This will just be taking up space in already crowded schools, and having schools waste money on a emotion coding system.

These Facial Action Coding Systems will be even more of a distraction. Phones are already enough of a distraction this will be even worse. Kids will just make face expressions to find out what emotion a certain face tells. ""Empathy (feeling somone else's emotional state..."" Most kids like to just have their space and not be bothered. This is also spending money on things that are not mandantory so money will just be wasted. At the end of the day like who is really interested in what a face expression tells about you?

00e047b,"A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.

The smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)

Vauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is "" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (source 3)

In 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars.

Limiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.            ",4

00eabc5,"Just Straight FACS

Anybody can read a room. Whether it's at a party, an important meeting, a funeral, or a Pre-Calculus lesson at 8 a.m., it's easy to look around and see how the people around you are feeling due to body language and facial expression.

Others don't think so, though. Prof. Thomas Huang and his team of experts have come up with new tech that can recognize all 44 muscles in the human face, and create a diagnostic on how a person is feeling. This is interesting, yes, but some may think that this technology could be used in classrooms to get a general feel on what each student is feeling about a lesson.

I believe that using the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in a classroom setting would have no merit and would just be a waste of time and money in public schools across America, because of how weak the technology in the FACS actually is.

In the text, Dr. Huang says that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" and that ""varying degrees of expression"" can still be used to recognize the feelings and emotions of any human being. When applying this to a classroom enviroment, this can't be correct. That is due to many natural factors in humans.

For example, the world has progressed a lot, and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed to be involved in regular classes. For a student with a form of autism, it may be hard for them to convey certain emotions on a regular basis. The technology wouldn't be able to read their face correctly. Another example is for a student with a physical disability whose face couldn't be read properly by the FACS. There are too many outliers for the technology to be accurate, unless you had a room of children who all express their emotions like an open book.

The text also says that ""most human communications are nonverbal."" I agree with this statement, actually. It proves that one can never tell what a person is thinking just by what they say, or their facial expressions. The only true place you can know how somebody really feels is in their mind. I, for one, never really say or express how I feel about school infront of any sort of teacher or staff. It's a general rule among students at my school to onlt talk about teachers or lessons outside of the classroom. Now, this may not be how it is in other public school settings. If it happened to, though, then the FACS technology would be obsolete in its purpose.

Lastly, in paragraph 9, the text says that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""putting on a face"", or a poker face, actually trains your body to be in a better mood. This means that literally anyone could trick the FACS into thinking that they were in a happy mood when need be. Students could easily ""beat the system"" by manipulating the FACS into giving off a false diagnostic every time, and therefore ruining the FACS's credability. Until the FACS can tell when a group of teenagers are faking their emotions, it can't perform its main task.

In conclusion, Dr.Huang's FACS technology cannot work due to how baseless it's ethics are, how difficult it really is to understand emtions just by facial expression, and how easy it is to manipulate it's process.",4
00ef89f,"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever and here is why.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

00f3984,"The Face that is on Mars, is just a natural landform. I am here to prove that it is just a natural landform. All of my reasons will come from the passage named ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

I know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in the passage it is stated that when the spacecraft Viking 1 was circling it was snapping photos when it spotted a shawdowy figure like a human face on a region on the planet named Cydonia. After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia. Next, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor Camera snapped pictures better than the ones that Viking took. Thousands of peole waited for when the image would first appear on a JPL web site. The website revealed that it was just a natural landform after all. Finally, in the very last paragraph it said, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are similar to landforms common around the American West. A scientist named Jim Garvin said ""it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Gavin also stated ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.

So therefore, all of the reasons stated above prove that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It formed a long time ago and that is something to figure out in the future.",2
00f6383,"Lately there has been a lot of contreversy with ways to elect and which way is more effective and what is preferred by the majority of people. The problem with that is that many people are very biased when it comes to elections. Many poeple are raised with a certain way that their parents might have thought them was correct and that was how they were taught to elect. Although there is not a wrong way to elect, there are more effective and quicker ways to do it. I personally think that the best way to vote would be through popularity.

Electoral College is a ""compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."". Many people think that Electoral College is rubbish and complicated and I agree. According to paragraph ten in the passage the first sentence says "" Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" which means that it is more of a process to vote through this system. Instead of you inputing your opinion on who you would like to be President you are basically saying that you believe that this slate of electors have a better idea of who would be a better President.

The electoral college is known to be extremely unfair to voters. In paragraph thirteen the second sentence states ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" which is true because the slate of electors are obviously teams of people who root for the same candidate which gives independent voters close to no chance if they are not voting for the same candidate.

Overall I think that the electoral college way of voting is old and worn out and maybe its time that it went out of business and the popular vote takes its place. With the popularity vote not only do you get to have a chance of choosing the president without the electoral vote canceling out your vote but you also get to go around saying that you're part of the reason why your candidate won. Many people may disagree with me and say that my opinion is not a good opinion but from all of the statements that I have heard, I will still continue to believe that the popularity vote is the best way to vote.

00f6ac7,"With conditions far harsher than on Earth and anything humans have expirenced, one the closes planet to Earth, Venus is increadibly inhosbitable. Dispite those facts scientists are still fascinated by the planet do to it's increadible similarity to Earth, but the conditions have prevented scientists from investigating throughly. With all spacecraft sent to Venus being destroyed it is a suprise that we are still trying to study this planet, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gives very little insight into why scientists are still attempting to study the planet.

To start off Venus is our sister planet with very similar density and size to Earth with similar features with mountains, valleys, and other rocky structures. The author states that many scientists think that Venus could have supported life long ago and may have been covered in ocean and if this is true we may get much insight as to why Venus would change to become an exteremly inhospitable planet. Though the author gives us very little as to what we will be able to do with this information or what other information we may get. The author also mentions space travel but states only that, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crusial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" 4). Other than that small mention the author does not go into depth on this idea.

Though the thought of being able to explore and study one of the closes planets to us is great the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" does not do to good of a job of informing us as to why we would attempt to weather such harsh conditions. With the temperature going over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure that could liquify metal its hard to reason why we should attempt to send probes to Venus let alone travaling there personaly and the author does not do a very good job covincing us that this is a good idea. They give us very little information as to what they will get from this and give us information that makes this sound crazy to attempt. ",3
00fca9b,"The authors sugestion that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how he supported his claim shows his enthusiasm in the topic of exploring venus.This is supported in how he says its a worthy pursuit, how human curitostity will lead to equally dangerous endeavors, and the fascination astronomers have with venus.

When the author's how human curiosity lead to dangerous endeavors is shown in paragraph 3 stating that the atmosphere is covered in highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds.

Another example is how exploration in venus is a worthy pursuit is in paragraph 2 stating ""... contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us."" shows the challenge in studying venus.

Lastly the astronimers fascination with venus is stemed from the fact venus has features simalor to earth.The author states that ""The planet has a suface of rocky sediment...features such as valleys, mountains, and crators."" show the simalaritis are still there.

In conclusion his idea has a multitued of support in his artical.",3
00fd564,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is valuable because it can help students learn the material the instructor is teaching that day much faster allowing the students to have a fun yet educational experience in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System will make the classroom more entertaining to all grade levels even in college, and the system will identify the emotions the user is feeling and will adjust the lesson plan to the students' liking.

The emotions are one of the only ways we can tell what each other are feeling but also thinking at the moment.

These days the only way that communicate mainly is through texting and most people don't like to call each other because people are becoming too caught up in technology to actually talk to the person they are trying to communicate with.

Also the people are becoming too lazy to actually call the person or actually go to the person in person and have their conversation with them.

In the education department of the government they are coming up with all these standardized test to prove that the student is eligiable to go to the next level of education, but in most of the schools in the United States who use these standardized tests most of the students fail the test and have to retake the test again the next year or semester.

With Professor Huang's creation of this tecnology the education system will be getting better and better tests results if this system is implemented into the schools all around the United States.

The Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because every child deserves a good education even if they are poor or don't have money to pay for the schooling.

The reason the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because the software will help students all grade levels succeed in the real world and have a good education and will help the student find good jobs once they graduate high school or college.

The Facial Action Coding System could actually help therapy patients and patients with PTSD and help the therapists, doctors, and counselors figure out what the patients are thinking or feeling at the moment.",3

Nasa wants to send humans to study venus it will be dangerous to go to venus but its worth the try to see if its good like weather and to see if there oxygen. venus is like Earth twin they are really close to each other but venus density and size are occasionally bigger.

Venus has over ninety seven percent of carbon dioxide. Whats more challening is that there are more clouds than earth. the temperatures can also be very dangerous up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater then normal earth averrage.

Michael Malin even took a better picture twenty two years later that showed it wasn't a face, but some people weren't satisfied. Three years later they took an even better one, showing that it wasn't a face at all.

This is not a face becasue the author says in paragraph two, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows"" Some people didn't agree because ""it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of the year"" and to disprove this they took a better picture in the summer.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

In the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.

A second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.

Throughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",4

""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.

But many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look.

On paragraph twelve, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""

01290ec,"Luke Bomberger is a who had started working in a grocery story and a bank, just when he got out of high school. Once he went on this trip to Europe with his friend Don Reist. Luke started enjoying going to oversea trips, even though he knew it would take a long time. Have you ever wanted to take an oversea trip? If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration. Its for SEagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything! Taking care of animals is another thing to, if you absolutely love animals than of course you might want to join. Especially if you are a farmer boy.

Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas. I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life. When Luke was on that trip he loved it, he first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended , on August 14th. On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger! Keep in mind that you can see animals , help people, and you can also visit places you have never visited in your whole life.",3
012c9be,"Have you ever thought there was a possiblity of going to venus? Yeah i didnt either but i completly agree with the autors point of view on this article i agree about going to venus for more information cause it would help us understand what happened to venus and if one point and time it was like earth.

The challenge of going to venus with anything is its massive air pressure, solfuric acid rain, and really hot surface temptures and we currently dont have anything to actually be able to survive those condtions for more then maybe three weeks or less so what i say we do is that we look at metals that are restiant to stuff like that and see if we could try combining the atoms to make an alloy.

In conclusion in my personal opionion i think yes we should try a little harder to get to know more about venus cause it would explain a kot and tell us if one day it was like earth and what happened to it so we could avoid it so that doesnt happen to earth and on top of that the more we learn about it the more the possiblity of it maybe becoming a hospital planet to go to if we need to ever move off of earth.

But despite the belife that life was there, it's also that NASA and others are just curios of what they could find from Venus.

First, the author did a good job pointing out and bringing in the reader with Venus ""once have been most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago"" but he also goes and continues on how it was covered with ""oceans""

Secondly, the author tell's us that there are ""familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"" On Venus. This makes us want to pursuit the study on Venus despite the dangers it presents. Even with all the critical coditions Venus has, this example want's us to go and visit Venus.

Lastly, "" Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity."" Human curiosity makes us want to go to Venus and see what we can find and look. Most humans are very curios and when they find out there was once life in Venus, it makes us want to go and see what's out there. The author put this in to give us another reason why we should go out to Venus. He puts in ""human cruiosity"" to bring us in.

Finaly, from all of the eight paragraps I feel as if the author could have done a better job on their part to explain why it's ""worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" Also that the comparison between Earth and Venus was fine. But going to Venus and exploring and pointed out that there was once life in Venus gives a good example of going and exploring Venus.",3
013ac83,"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are  acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.  acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.  it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/her house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.    ",4

Also that by seeing pictures of hwo aliens look there similar too us in a way , but the mouth is weird shping like it's not a human mouth that people think it may be . Makes you have second thoughts and makes you want to investigate more on the "" The Face On Mars "" . Each year we have something new on this face of mars.

So we investigate more on these pictures to see exactly what were trying to find out because it doesn't add up how would I big hu,man face be on mars. doesn't make since too me. Yeah and like "" Garvin "" says we don't pass over a human face very often so something isn't right here. The scientist put there all into this to figure out what there dealing with.

So finally in 2001 we've came to an conclusion and find out from all our investigations that it's really just a ' mesa ' It's an Middle Butte in the Snakwe River Plain of Idaho It's the same height of as "" Face on Mars "".",1
014f1b3,"Dear state senator,

I think that changing to election by popular vote is the best thing to do. We vote and see which ones most popular and that's who gets to be president. Because more people think he'll be a better president. Another reason is that's what people want. Lastly we wont make the wrong choice. We vote and see who's the best but also theres an election process. We think it would be better with no election process at all. I was imformed that we dont really vote for president, we vote for a slate of 34 democratic pledged to that person. so basicaly were not really voting so and so for president. So it seems like the govenment is fooling us. i just think we the people should vote for president not a slate but the president. and whom ever has the most popular votes wins. The government thinks they know whats best but what happens when people dont go threw with what they say,, we know whats best.                    ",2
0151c0f,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",4
0155be4,"Everyone would like to have car that drives them around. But whouldn't people get annoyed with not being in control. Having driverless cars are cool in some way but also can be dangours. There are positive and negative to have the driverless cars. They shouldn't develop driverless cars because drives still have to be alert, nobody wants to wait their turn to drive, and taffic laws say only a safe car is when a human has full control of it at all times.

The drivers that are in the car still have to be alert. The driverless car alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways. Also when they are dealing with traffic. Like roadwork, or accidents the driver has to take the wheel at those times.

Nobody wants to wait for their turn to drive. Driveless cars only let the drivers drive when they are in traffic or pulling out somewhere. Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive. Most people wont like the car being in control and not them.

Some laws are written with the assumption that the only safe about a car if a human has control of it at all times. Most states it's illegal to even test computer driven cars. There are some countrys that limited use of semi-autonmous cars but the manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as they know the cars are safe.

Driverless cars are good for someone people but most people would like to be in control when they drive. They shouldn't develop the cars if only some of the people like the cars and will use them.

0156ea6,"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours.

It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure.

So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere.",1
015ac93,"Should venus be explored? There are many different aspects, and opinions on the subject, but the author gives us very good reasons why it should be explored and studied. One of the reasons is that belive it or not venuse is the most simalar planet to earth, also the scientist at NASA said they are working on a blimp like vehicle that could go up to 30 miles high. That means if they made this structer they could avoid all of the harsh conditions on ground level at venus such as the armospheric pressure, and the unbarable heat that is a crazy total of 800 degrees. If they would make this vehicle the pressure would drop substantionaly and so would the heat from 800 degrees to around 170 degrees, the solar power and radation would also be very plentiful and wouldn't exceed Earth levels. The conditions would definetly no be easy to deal with, but they would at least be survivable. There is one problem thought people at NASA can not document their finding because of conditions which would make it where cameras could not be used. This is because the most the light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher. But there maybe a solution, the thing is we might just have to go back in time. For example scientists are looking back on older technology, this technology would be mechanical computers, this is good because these computers do not requier any technology, they use gears and levers and would be substainable on venus. That is how the author suggests that the study of venus should be pursued. As it said in the artical dont look at it such as dangers just bigger challenges.",3
016010c,"Driverless Cars

Driverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.

Driverless cars are really beneficial. Driverless cars have way more senors and alerts than regular cars. For example, if the car is about to back up into an object, the driver's seats will vibrate to let you know. Also, within the past 10 years, sensors on the driverless cars have become way more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Driverless cars are also very safe to use. The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word ""driverless"" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7)

Driverless cars are going to become the next big thing. They won't just become beneficial to you, but everyone else as well. The cars would only use half the fuel that today's taxi use. Which is a huge deal because we as a whole, we use a lot of fuel. Also, it will offer more flexibility than a bus. Just imagine that. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes these such cars would fundamentally change the world, and everyone else should believe that too. (Paragraph 1)

Some people may agrue that letting a car be in control is just absurb. You never know what the car might do. It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are very safe and have major benefits. Some people may be scared of letting a car be in a control, instead of them being in control of the car. But no one should have nothing to worry about. As long as you stay alert, you should be fine. Even though the car can do many things by itself, it still sends you heads up when it needs your assistance. Driverless cars coming very soon in the near future. Try them and see how they are.",5
0163804,"Cars have been a necessity to us for as long as I can remember. Billions of people around the world use cars everyday. Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do. Thinking of a world without cars is unreasonable to the people of today, but if they thought of all the good not driving everyday does for the world then it would probably be a different story.

Many places are enforcing people to go without there cars transporting them everyday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, ""Seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here."" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, ""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In saying this he portraying that we need to focus on more important things and stop worrying about cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.

Vauban isn't the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also. Robert Duffer states, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" By saying this the author is explaining how the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city's. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our enviroment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.

Bogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" He and many other citizens of this place agree with saving our enviroment and not using cars. Not using cars is less stressful because your not consistently worring about gas, the car breaking, or getting into an accident with another driver.

Just imagine your life without using a car everday. Not using a car isn't that bad and doesnt hurt you or the people around you as much as it does having one. Using a car everyday puts your life at risk, takes your money, and hurts the enviroment. Life without cars would be simpler and less stressful in our world today.                                    ",4

One way that the new new facial action coding system would be good to read emotions of students because it could help figure out people's emotions. One deatil to support my claim is that in the story it says "" for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face , of course most of us would have troube actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy or sad.

Venus is really challenging to explore because of it's harsh environment and a "" thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"". in the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author stated that, "" no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" this quote shows that the environment in Venus is so harsh that not even a space craft made out of metal., could withstand the enormous pressure of it's atmosphere. in addition, scientist are really facinated by Venus because it's the only planet that resembles earth.

Venus is worth exploring because it was probably covered in oceans a long time ago. in the article the author said, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". this implies that, since there probably used to be water on Venus, there is a chance that Venus could have supported life at one point. because where there is water, there must be life.

01711c3,"Driveless cars can be a very great enhancement in the future's society. Driveless cars can save fuel, they have very high experience, and they contain many gadgets to hold itself together for a very long time.

""He envisions a future with public transportation system where fleets of drivelss cars form a public-transport taxi system.

Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" (Paragraph 2) Their has been very little accidents with driveless cars than there has been with humans driving cars.

Third reason why driveless cars are positive to the society is that the Google cars has many reasonable parts and technology to ""hold itself together."" ""Google modified Toyota Prius using position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof, Dubbed LIDAR."" (Paragraph 4) The technology of all the input is great enough to acheive the skill of a human at the wheel.

Driveless cars can be very helpful to society. However, traffic laws writes that with a assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Feedback from the Google cars driving before 2009 spectulates that,""So far, they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveway or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" (Paragraph 2) Driveless cars don't have complete control over the car at all times, so drivers must still be focused at all times.

0187e96,"Do you think you would be able to live without your car? It would be less difficult than you think! In fact, there is a whole town named Vauban, Germany, that has given up their cars! According to Source 1, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, unless of course you have the money to buy a parking garage space for a whopping $40,000. A citizen of the car-less town, Heidrum Walter admits, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas of the US, according to Source 1. If only we had more towns like Vauban, maybe our impact on the world would be less destructive.

Some towns ban cars for a few days at a time. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. Congestion in Paris went down 60 percent and the smog from the pollution cleared up enough that they rescind the ban. Some people would complain that having little to no cars will be an issue for jobs, delivery companies, or getting children to and from places. There's always a bus, and there's always the option of car pooling! Bogota, Columbia is another town that has done a car free day, except Bogota's is annual. These Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to places during the car-free day, according to Source 3. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of this annual car-free day, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in Bogota. I think more towns should ban cars for just a few days. We could all get a little excersize, help the environment, and improve our mood and lower stress!

A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, Source 4 says. The number of miles driven in the US was at it's height in 2005 and dropped steadily after. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was almost 9 percent below that peak! Some sociologists believe that if this pattern continues, it will have lots of beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, according to Source 4. Some places, such as New York, have car-sharing programs and bike-sharing programs, which is a nice way to get from place to place that's healthy for you and your environment.

There's so many reasons why we should use our cars less! Like I explained, it's very healthy for your environment, and if you choose to walk or bike, its healthy for your body, too. Also, pollution rates would go down quite a lot if we would just carpool or walk/bike to places! People have said that they feel so much happier and stress free from not using a car all the time. So why not take the time to help your environment and call somebody up to carpool, get that bike fixed, or hop on that bus!                                    ",4
018985d,"Identifying Human Emotions

Imagine being able to figure out exactly how anyone in this world are feeling with just a computer. Now software has developed that could help you do just that. The Fcial Action Coding System has applications that will be extraordinary to modern day technology.

Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman created the the FACS. All which have six emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are emotions that are used on a daily basis around the world so they are pretty basic. Video imagery is used that tracks one's facial movements. Therefore it can identify mixed emotions. The video imagery compares each expression with a neutral face in order to figure your emotions.

Imagine being at school on your classroom computer learning something boring, and all of a sudden the topic becomes fun. Dr. Huang predicts that your classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. It would be useful to many students in order to make and help them learn better. This same technology could make identifying emotions much easier. The boring lesson for you would modify. This way the computer will know to keep giving you boring lessons or fun ones.

Facial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work. Not only do your muscles express emotion, but they also help produce them. The article states that a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. This clearly would help the actors express themselves better, thanks to our face muscles. People may not notice, but we imitate other people's facial expressions with empathy.

Who would have thought that sience and technology could be involved with a big feature of who we are. Sometimes being able to figure how someone is feeling. At times we may even have to bug them in order to figure the emotion. Now with the new technology of FACS, this task will be easier. Even for students in a classroom, this will be valuable.               ",3

To begin, I strongly disagree with driveless cars, because people love to be in control. For an example, a marriage relationship the husbad and the wife both think their in control or want to be.. Do you actully think that people will let go of their saftey for a car that drives on its own? Can the American citizen trust a car that on its own?

Also if the car can drive on its own what the point of a person getting their lisense. Or what about an whole sport create from driving Nascar. This would be an perfect upset for a roit. You have owners of the driving sports losing money for an driveless car that is not really safe. For an example, think about tapes and cds how they drop in production. Since poeple have ipods mp3s,itunes, and phones their no need to keep making production for music. So to bring back the driveless car could evn make the economy at drop.

To carry forward, is the nation ready for the change, theirs a prieod of time with everything. Are we sure that us humans are not jumping into things to fast.

For an example, the Model -T the nation rode on horses very long time before Ford became the new era. even with the horse they did revole many they had the invention on the light bug with the horse carriage.

018ff85,"Driverless cars are the future! ""Google has had cars that could drive idependently since 2009. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far , Google cars aern't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when dealing with complicated traffic issues.'' Driverless cars have been around for a while now; even though they are not fully developed they are becoming more and more relavent and it's time to imbrace that. Imbrace that they may even help prevent any sort of crash in the future. While also getting people to thier destinations fast and saftely.

There are still problems to face even in the light of things. For example.

""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivier, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states t is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" There are still many strides to take in acheving driverless cars on rode but as soon has those obsticles are tackled everyone will be much happier. With saftey has the main concern the laws that will be made for these driverless cars will insure that the utmost care and concern for health take precident. As soon

has the laws have been made the states wil also be more open the idea of a drverless car on thier streets.

Has stated earlier there are still a few problems with the idea of driverless cars but they are really close to frution. Possibly even on the cusp on perfection. ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the rode ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

All of that simply means driverless cars are not 100 percent driverless but they very very close. If they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves thats half the battle and the rest will follow in suite with time.

""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotatng sensor on the roof, a video camera mountedd near the rearview mirrior, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciver, and an inertial motion sensor. The most impportant bit of technology in this system is the spinn sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constanctly uppdating 3-D model of the car's surrondings."" The technology is there for the drverless cars to start becoming a real prossiblity in the near future. They may even fully take over and allow for a much more easy going experinces while driving. And also allow for beyond human level control of the ride.

"" Telsa has prjected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on the autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plam to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The rode to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us. but we grow closer to the destination everyday."" Fully driverless cars really are in the near future. There are small little pushes that still must be made but right around the corner of those is a paradise of safe relaxing transportation for all to use. With driverless cars the future will be a bright one. And saftey while driving will no longer be a concern. ",4

Bascaily saying that the vehicle would have hard time to stay on the ground. The temperature would be as The text states in paragraph 5 ""around 170 degrees fahrenheit"".

019e2c4,"Have you ever thought about what the world would be without cars? You're probably telling yourself how would I get from my house to the stores. Maybe you should try walking because cars tend to cause damage to our environment. We the people should try limiting driving because if we do we won't have pollution,we wouldn't have to deal with smog,and even better protect our environment. Greenhouse gas has reduced since automobiles were limited in the suburbs.

Limiting cars could have a great impact on reducing air pollution. Countries such as China are known as one of the most polluted countries due to th amount of gas it uses. A businessman Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""this identifies that people actually care about pollution. Pollution can also be bad for us humans because not only does it affect our breathing but it can also led to death due to the types of chemicals that we take in. Paris is a city who has dealt with smog and took care of the situation really quickly.

Smog is a major factor why people all around the world are either limiting driving or even banning cars with in the region. An example of that would be Paris who had were near a record day setting of pure smog. The effect of this led Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear air of the global city. Motorist were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer the consequences by getting fined 22-euros. This difference led to a congestion which went down to about 60 percent in the capital of France. Animals have suffered the most since cars started to evolve or became more useful.

The environment in which we live in has suffered consequences as well. Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency are stepping in to help out within the community. They started to propmote car reducing due to the 80 percent of approprations by law have gone to highways and the rest towards other transportations.

Now you see why we should start walking instead of driving because its good for our health but the main reason is that it limits driving. It also reuces pollution as well as smog, and keeps the environment clean. Are you willing to sacrifice your driving addiction for the sake of human kind and our animals.            ",3
019e8c3,"Driverless cars could be the car of the future.

Many companies like GM and Google are working to create the driverless car.

They are working on improving the models that were already created, but these new care could lead to bad events.

Because of the lack of human attention, computer errors, and new liability questions driverless cars should not be developed.

Sitting in the driver's seat of a driverless car, may cause more issues than benefits.

According to the article, ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

In order to drive. the human can not be distracted by phones or food, but with the idea of being in a driverless car, the human will be.

In self-driver cars, people are distracted by their phones, even though they must pay attention to road.

The distracions will be more dangerous in driverless cars because as the article states, ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. When people enter the new cars, they will believe that they do not have to pay attention because the car is driverless.

When the car malfunctions, the person is the car would be so distracted that even with devices to get the driver's attention, he or she would not be able to react quickly enough.

The extreme lack of attention would cause accidents, injuries, and deaths.

Driverless cars are run by sensors, hardware, and software.

In many cases, these items are known to crash or suddenly stop working.

A computer crashing can lead to bad events and having that computer crash while driving a car would make the events twice as worse.

The brakes may stop working, the car might steer itself off the road, or it could even steer into another car.

If humans have no control over the car, they can not try to steer the car the other way when it crashes.

People would believe they are invincible with the new cars, but techhnology is know to fail.

When technology fails, the driverless car would get into some crash.

With the crash, liabiltiy questions would erupt.

The article states that ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""

The person in the driver seat would want to blame the car and the company that created it.

The car company would want to blame the person for lack of attention.

According the the article, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.""

This creates more trouble for state governments.

Driverless cars seem great innovative with the idea of not having to ever drive again.

Although there is real danger that accompanies driverless cars.

With the thought of the car being invincible, humans will be less alert.

When the system goes down, people would not be able to react in time.

The people who do not react in time would cause accidents and blame the car companies.

Driverless cars would be more trouble than helpful. ",3
01a0d33,"In this article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,""

the author states negative and positive things about driverless cars. There are many reasons these cars can be positive or negative. The driverless cars would have a more positive effect on the driving world. There are multiple reasons the driverless cars are a good thing for everybody.

The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This evidence from the article shows that these driverless cars are safe. There are multiple crashes a day with regualr human driven cars. With these driverless cars humans would be much safer. The text also states, ""Google cares aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver..."" This shows that the car is not fully driverless, but this may help to keep the driver alert. This helps whoever is driving stay more alert while on the road.

According to the text, ""For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" This illustrates how the company will add many sensors to the driverless car. They want to make the car as smart as possible. This text shows that they are trying to copy the skill of a human driving a car.

One example from the text is ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."" This proves that the driverless cars can do many things. It goes to show how many good qualities the driverless car has. There are many more things about this car that are very helpful when it comes to driving.

Many people may say that driverless cars are a negative thing. All of this evidence from the text clearly states that they are very positive. They may say they are too expensive or that they are not completley driverless. The company is not done constructing these smart cars. They are hoping to become fully driverless. There are very few negative aspects about the driverless car.

There are many positive things about the driverless car. The development of these cars is going to have a positive effect on many people around the world. These cars will help

keep people safe. The world is constantley changing with new technology. This car is just another positive change in the world.           ",3
01a39ed,"Since the beginning of time people have always wanted the next big thing. After watching many movies where cars that don't need drivers are being used, people have wanted to make this a reality. Since 2009 there have been cars that could drive independently under certain conditions (paragraph 2). However, by making these driverless cars legal it makes driving even more dangerous.

In paragraph 7 it states ,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" After drivers get use to this car they will be more relaxed and not as alert as usual. It will be easy for drivers to drift off or get distracted. This is because the car is doing most of the work. This could cause many wrecks that could injure not only the driver, but others on the road too.

When driving a driverless car many drivers would not be aware of their surroundings. In paragraph 8 it says , "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the in-car system is actually a saftey feature."" If drivers are texting while using a Driverless car , then it means they are not paying attention. In an emergency the driver would not have enough time to stop. If a child or animal ran out infront of the car, it would be to late. The driver would not have enough time to react and stop the car. The car would not have enough time to alert the driver.

Another con about a driverless car is who to blame when an accident occurs. Paragraph 9 states ,"" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" Many car accidents take place each day, which means the odds of a driverless car getting in an accident are probably pretty likely. If this did occur the driver could blame the manufacture saying that the car didn't alert the driver. The manufactures could blame the driver by saying that any driver of a driverless car must always be alert. This now affects not only the driver, but the manufactures and the other people in the accident.

Driverless cars would make roads even more dangerous and unsafe. They give drivers an excuse to not pay attention to the road and the things around them. This could cause very serious accidents. It is safest if cars remain where drivers are always in control. ",4
01a53e1,"In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggustion that Venus is worth studying has many thoughts in our heads. Is it really worth it? Should we consider it or focus on our planet? Well, the author has many reasons to why we should continue researching it.

A supported reason to the author belief is that it could be a back up plan for us if something were to happen to earth. in the text it says,"" Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too"" ( paragraph 2). Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. IT would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing.

Another reason is it could help us with futuristic things. Better things than what he whave right now. In the article it stated,"" Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. It would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing"" ( paragraph 5). We can find and build different tools to help us reach Venus and to study more about what could be our future planet.

While i see the authors mindset on this article, there are many con's to the ""twin"" planet. Its not very survivable land for us to stay and live in. In the text it says,""

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface. ( paragraph 3). This can cause alot of damage and lots of fear within people if we were to ever live here

01ad79e,"Honestly, i feel very in the middle of this subject.It indeed would be nice for teachers to know when and what a stdents emotions are but,at the same time that could also be a pesonal thing. school computers should detect sadness,boredum, and or anger.On the other hand, it could be a good thing.What if the kid is very sad all day everyday?The device could send at message to the teacher so that they can talk.this could prevent a suicide and more things in that nature.

The reaon I think this is because like I said before thats not the schools buisness if im sad or happy.I wouldnt mind anyone knowing my emotions,but everyone isint me, people have different opinions and very many peopke wouldnt like that.

So I think id give my honest opinion and go with i dont know evryone isin't the same and were all human and have different opinions,characteristics ect..If it were to be in school computers i'd say you should give out a form for the sudent and or psrent to sign.Nothing like that should just be added.If this is added to school computers it Should be strongly suggested if not approved by parents.

01ae85f,"Dear State Senator, I am feeling the need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes for the president of the united states. I feel this way for three reasons. The first reason is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.

The first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the Electoral College still has it's defenders. That was the first reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The second reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes, is because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, butr for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So the Electoral College usually wins since the votes go in to the House of Representatives first, which is really unfair to the other people that are doing the election. That was the second reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The last reason why I think that they need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes, is because at the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair nto voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. But it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arrguments in favor of it are mostly asserstions without much basis in reality. That was the last reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

State senator i'm writing you this letter so you can hopefully change the Electoral College to election by popular votes. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. so the only last words that I have to say to you are: Abolish the Electoral College!    ",3
01b55c8,"Fellow Citizens, there are many reasons why limiting car usgage has outstanding oppritunities and advantages.

For an example, If there aren't people out there spending their hard earned money that they worked for, for an expensive car that they are just going to use to get to someplace faster when they could just stop being lazy for once and walk or run, ride bikes, hike, or take a bus, instead of spending money after money to fill a car up to just waste gas, and to fill it up again. Running, riding bikes, hiking, etc. gives you a chance to experience reality. Being outside gives people a chance to see the earths real beauty, and to smell the fresh air. Limiting car usage helps people stay in shape and keeps them healthy if their not just sitting in a car for half a hour when they could be running or walking.

Residents in Vauban, Germany are permitted car ownership, but there are only two places to park : large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. About 70 percent of Vauban's families do not iwn cars, an about 57 percent sold a car to move there. Having a car makes peoples tense, and being in a place where there isnt alot of car usgae makes people much happier. People who live in places where cars arent used as oftn as other states, those towns place stores in walking distance, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

An amazing advantage that people can can from limiting the usage of cars is less drunk drivers, or even none. If there's less drunk drivers, there's less car crashes and less deaths. Everyone understands that you have to be 21 or older in most states to drink alcoholic beverages. The big adavntage out of this is, if older people were to get drunk, they would be forced to call a cab, or even walk home. Their not putting noone else's life in danger, and this would lower the crashes and death fatalities per year.

As as many cars that there is in the world, all the use of them would probably pollute the world. Paris enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of the near-record pollution.

Limiting car usage gives you the oppritunity to be with your family and friends and spend more time with them then you normally would having a car. You can walk and talk with them on the way to work, you can stop by the park and have some fun on your way to the grocery store. The best part about this is, you dont have to worry about the roads being busy. You ca walk, run, hike, and bike without having to hear the noisy streets, the honking, the screeching, etc.

What's the point in having a car that your just going to be wasting money on, when running, walking or riding a bike is free and even cheaper and safer than driving a car. What are you gonna do when your car breaks down? Are you gonna keep spending your money on when it keeps breaking? Why do that when you have two perfectly good and healthy legs and you can run or walk somewhere?

Just take a moment to think about the fines every single person breathing in the world has received? Alot of money wasted on something idiotic huh? just imagine if every state, continents, islands, and places we dont know about all stopped using cars, or even just limited the car usage. We'd be saving a whole ton of money, we'd basically all be middle classes.

This whole situation is a win-win, You get to be with your family 24/7, Running, walking, biking, hiking etc. is all an amazing way to keep people healthy. People dont have to worry about drunk drivers, or car crashes, or car fatalities. People can finally stop spending their hard earned money that they're just going keep spending and wasting on gasoline or to fix your car when its having problems and it breaks. Families can save the money that they would normally be spending on gasoline and start saving for a trip to take their family on to spend more time with them, or to take a trip for yourself.

There are plently more reasons and outstanding advantages that limiting car usage gives you, but these are some of the very best! Just remember, The only good advantages a car can give you is getting you somewhere faster, and keeping you comfortable and safe. But they are also the most danagerous, and expensive things out there. They can take your life or someone elses in an instant, and they can put you in debt quicker than you know! Limitng car usage is for you!    ",4
01b9b63,"I think its wrong to use the Facial Action Coding System on students in their classroom. One of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results. Another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy, and not every school could afford a machine like this. Also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read

Most students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student. Also the student could be sad, angery, or happy about something totally differant from school work, and that means it could throw the machine off.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools and never should be. Machines should never be able to read emotions.",2

Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to put them in large garages at the edge of the development , where a car - owner buys a space for 40,000 along with a home ( 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars para 2 ). Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of global cities. ( Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog para 10 ). Diesel was blamed , since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline .

As well in sources 3 & 4 Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota and cars have come to an end with culture. They feel as though when people ride bikes , and trains it can prevent car jams. ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 20 ).The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. In ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 35 ). shows that for example van services can share services to have less cars and less gasoline .

01bb07c,"Dear State Senator,

After conducting studies on the American voting system ,I noticed many flaws. Deciding on presidency is one of the most vital processes in any countrie,so it should be addresed properly. the fact that voters vote not for president ,but they vote for slate of electors,the electors can be anyone not holding public office,and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states  are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters dont vote for president ,but they are actually voting for electors is should be looked into because the people are not  voting for president .The are voting for people to vote for president .which throughly explains the idea that the majority oppinion of the nation is invaluable to the goverment and our society  .This system is not fair .Nor is this system equal. and nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countrie .

The electors can be anyone not holding public office .This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic .Bestowing any dreg of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea .This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. He could mislead us and vote for any canidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by canidates in 2000. which leads U.S citezens  to ask questions like:Is our oppinion valuable or even considerd valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countrie or do they want POWER?Do our votes even matter or make a diffrence ?Should we just give up on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the prepective of our founding fathers .They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were people's oppinions dont matter,With often and misleading corrupt electors  not letting the majority rule .This system should be put to an end ,So our countrie can live free again.                                                                    ",4
01bb2f3,"Are driverless cars safe? Cars have been around for many decades and more to come. Cars are used in peoples everyday life. Cars are developing in many ways. I think driverless cars are not developed because; it's not completely driverless,It's challenging, and the car isn't advance.

Frist, driverless cars are not completely driverless. In the text it says,''this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' If the car isn't completely driverless there is no point on getting a car like this. This car can only handle driving functions up to 25mph. This mean the driver needs to keep hold of the wheels.

Secondly, the driverless car is challenging. It means it's hard to drive. Driverless cars are dangerous. It's not even driverless completely. This type of technology is sometime too advance for people. In the text it says, ''drivers have to steer,accelerate, and brake themselves.'' The driver is doing all the work.

Lastly, the driverless car isn't that advanced. In the text it say,''none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' This car tells you bthe simplest thing. In the text it says,'' it notify the driver when there's a work zone and accident.'' This car isn't really that helpful.

The driverless car isn't developed. You still should have a hand of the wheel. This is not yet completely driverless. This car tells you the simplest thing and not advanced. Why would anyone want a car that just tells you the simplest things that you can tell form just looking up at the road.",2
01bd69c,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe she was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what she really felt in the painting. All we know is what we see today and thats her smiling.

01c1169,"Anyone and everyone has emotions. There are many different ways a person can feel and how they could express those feelings. But now, there's actually a way a person can ""calculate"" someone else's emotions. Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe, are now developing ways for humans to communicate with computers. To be more exact, they're looking for students to try out this new software. There are many reasons why they should try out this new and exciting innovation in technology.

The most important reason why they should use this software in schools is to see how the student is feeling at school. School is a very interesting and complex place. It can effect students in many different ways for the good or the bad. That is why this software is so important. In paragraph 6, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" As we all know, school can be very boring. This very reason is why an abundance of students aren't doing good in there classes. Administrators could use this information about the students to adjust there learning programs to make the lessons more interesting for the students. The computer can even go beyond classroom problems to mental health issues. School shootings have been a major problem recently and if a computer can detect a student's unhappiness, the school could stop the problem before it even happens.

All in all, this new computer software could help boost student's grades, make learning more interesting, and could even help save lives. ",3

01c46fa,"The article called "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes how a new technology called the facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Here you will find an arguement on whether or not the use of technology to read is the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Students using technology is a great way for them to express themselves. Once students understand how there technology works they will began expressing themselves through culture, Litilarcery, and so much more. In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it says "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This allows some computer software to recognize emotions.

Facial expressions are a very important detail in every individuals life. Reading someones facial expression can tell you what you need to do next. For example in paragragh 4 it says "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, "" even though individuals oftem show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly)."" So when your friends mad and doesnt want you near her or shes just confused, now you'll know your next step.

Emotions are not just expressions on ones face but body movement as well. Body Language plays an important roll in facial expressions. In paragragh 3 it tells us ""Eckman has classified six basic-emotion shappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movents of the facial muscles."" For example when your angery your orbicularis oris which is the place around your mouth, it tightens your lips up to show your emotion.

The use of technology to read emotional expressions are very important. It not only tells us our emotions but our body language as well. This allows us to tell what another person is feeling rather than ask them.",3
01c5073,"My views on technology being used to read students emotional expressions is, that I am against this idea in certain cases. I feel like this could go agaisnt someones privacy and the way others can view them in certain different ways they did before. I don't believe that people should use technology to figure out if someone is feeling sad, happy, angry, confused etc.. because it is there privacy and not for anyone else to know unless you tell them so.

Another reason I can give is that the technology is almsot pointless when we can do this ourselves, they say it themselves ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the simple look on their face"" The technology isnt needed when we can do this with our very own two eyes, The point of the techhnology is to give an accurate hypothosis of how we are feeling when we can give that just by talking to someone. There has been times where I've been texting people and know what there emotions is like just by texting them, when we get to know someone well enough we can sense if something is bothering them. This technology on the other hand takes that part of building a relationship with someone to a lower level, you would already know their emotions even in the classroom.

The last example I have is the fact that people can fake there emotons and people do it all the time. It is a tendency and human nature to put on a mask to hide if we are sad or hurt by something because at times we dont wanna hurt people. We could hide the way we feel all we want, because the computer doesnt know whats on the inside, it knows whats on the outside, which in another example in the first sentence saying ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" That is an example of the Leonardo Da Vinvi's ""Mona lise"" the question I have is how do we know thats how she actually feels? He doing a portait not telling her to show how she really feels while he paints. What I am getting at is, it is easy to put on a mask when everything does feel okay.

In conclusion, I don't think this technology is a bad idea, but I feel like it is not needed when we can figure it out just as much the computer can, just maybe not as on point so to speak, but it is someones privacy and not anyones elses unless the person chooses to say.",3

This made me feel curious of knowing more about it, One day knowing what scientist have discovered in planet Venus could be something amazing.

The danger that comes along with worth studing venus seems better not to try to move on with our lifes and stop trying to explore venus. But has that stopped people doing amazing things despite the danger it comes along with it? People have climbled all the way to the top of

Mount Everest being the biggest mountain on earth, coming along with danger with involving death or getting your hand or leg getting cut off because of the low temperatures. People going through the heardest things in life but later on succeding even when getting discriminated or getting yourself killed. But then you are known to being the most inflentual person on earth. All those things turned out to be amazing things, that know matter the consequences or danger it's better to try then not haved tried. There is something that will come along the way to get there. In evidence "" Another project is looking back to an old technonolgy called mechanical computers.

Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" So that's a step to trying to get to know more about it. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

Even though we been on earth for a thousands of years, But we are just getting to know or discover more things even out of our planet earth. Curosity is always on are minds for an example how many candies do you think are in that jar? or how did you make that object fit when it seems impossible to make it fit, and many more that makes us wanting to know more.

01c5e87,"No, i do not agree with America creating ""driverless"" cars . Depending on a machine to navigate the roads and sucessfully take you to your destination is an accident waiting to happen litterally. Who would be at fault if a wreck were to accure? Would you really be able to have piece of mind while letting your car do the driving?

First, you have to think about who would really be at fault if an accident happened. In the article it states that ""if technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" Well it would be challenging to understand that fully, because if something were to happen with one or more sensors malfunctioning, than how can you blame the driver in that case? The maufaturing companies would have to run numerous tests and double check to insure that all of the sensors and gadgets on the vehicle are in working order and stay that way so they deliver a safe product on their part. At the time of the wreck, you will have to take into concideration what each driver was doing, and the steps leading up to the event to come to a conclution of who fault it is.

Secondly, the cars arent 100% driverless, you still have to take over the wheel when need be. When in these cars, the driver has to give his/her full attention at all times, so you might as well be in an ordinary vehicle. A quote from the text states ""their cars have driven more than a million miles without a crash but sofar, Google's cars arent trully driverless; they alert the drivers to take over the when pulling in and out of drive ways or dealing with complicated issues, such as navagating through road work or accidents."" Having to take over when their is a contruction zone or driveways etc, is not the deffinition of a full driverless car to me.

lastly, the cars have fancy sensors and other tools and whatnot , but these cars still call for human skills. Driverless cars are intelligent but may not be able manage a situation if you were to look down at your phone quickly or something else along the lines of that. The information states that ""they can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. You have to stay focused on the road and guide the car if needed in a situation. if you want to not stay locked on the road and do another thing while in the car, these vehicles are not for you.

In conclusion, i do not approve of these inventions until it is proved that they are 100% safe and until you dont have to pay attention to driving the whole time. Driverless cars still need the skill of a human behind the wheel, they arent fully driverless and something may not work in proper order, and also you have to think about who would be at fault if a wreck happened. These are all things we need to take into concideration before going out and purchasing one of these new vehicles.

01c8f7a,"today i will be writing an essay on this machine called FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System it can read emotions from people in paintings and people that actually move it can tell you their emotions which i think is incredible in all but you can't just look at people's emotions without them knowing what your doing.

Most humans can already tell how our friends, family and other people are feeling just because we can look at them and tell how their feeling its as if we already knew hoow they felt just by the look on their face.

Everybody has an expression that shows how the feel each day a couple of genious's made an invention that changed the world it can tell you how a person is feeling in many different ways but they do it so everybody knows what they are feeling even though they might or might not know.

Everybody feels different emotions some might even be depressed because of maybe a loss of a family member or a best friend so might be angry because of many different things everybody have different emotions me i had depression for a long time and it took me a little bit to realize theres more to life than just sorrow or depression just move on and just try and find someone who makes me happy theres this girl that makes me happy we aren't dating but she gives me hope for the future as i said everybody is different.

So for my conclusion i think they should keep using the machine to study are feelings it may be helpful in the future so we know how to deal with it thank you for reading my essay.",2
01cbe3d,"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.

01d0836,"The challenge of Exploring Venus is that Venus sometimes called the Evening Star because is the one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Sometimes people called the Earth twins because Venus is the cloest planet to Earth term of density and size. Between Venus and Mars is the sun because there sun goes in different speed. Venus can be a challenging because of the clouds and of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.

This shows that Venu's has a thick atmosphere of almos 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venu's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what thet experiene on our own planet. The other thing is that Ven's has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our system. Beyond the high pressure and the heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediment like erupting volcanoes, pwerful earthquakes.

Venus can be a chanllenging because in Venus it has powerful earthquakes and also erupting volcanoes it's dangerous to be there because the temperature has the hottest surface of any other planets. Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

However Venus can be ship obriting or hovering safly far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because of the most forms of the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. People cannot take samples of rock or gas or anything else from a distance. They are challenging many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to there knowledge if Venus.

Now NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. There other project is called the mechanical computers. These devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940w during World War ll. All modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick, but they are tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Venu's has been the challenge it has been a value, but not only becuase of the insight to be gained, but also that human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors. There travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited because by the dangers and doubts. It's really dangerous to be in Venu's because you never know what will happen in that planet.     ",2
01d2df1,"The Future of Driverless Cars

Could you think about yourself not having to worry about driving your car anymore? This is becoming a possibility with all the new technology automobile companies are using to make this happen. But, there are some people that are opposed to this idea becasue of some problems that could come from this This idea also has a majority of supporters too which myself is one of them. There is some bad things about it dealing with traffic and accidents but there is stress relief for not having to drive and not worrying about the road. Also you would be able to do whatever you want while the car is driving to your destination.

I support the idea of the self driving car for many reasons that will soon help all drivers. ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" With the cars technology ability to be able to mimic the human driver is a huge factor for self driving because it can do all the driving that a human does normally. Some people especially hate driving because it casues them stress and anger so I think if every car was self driving there would be no problems, no traffic, and no accidents to worry about. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This quote is talking about how only few states let companies test autonomous cars which hinders the developement of the cars and their safety for all of us because how can you make a better car if you cant test in in real situations. This is a problem with the testing becaus ethe car cant become better and solve the problems if there is not testing done.

On the other hand of the argument there is many things still wrong with the cars and their saftey. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a big problem witht he cars because technology usually fails at some points in time and if this causes a big accident and people are hurt it will cause so much frustration and confusion on everyone invloved. Another point about the problems of the car is ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The quote has a big meaning because whats the point of having self driving cars that you need to worry about while its driving? ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The whole point of the self driving cars is its ability to be able to do these things so it should be able to switch could be developed later on.

So in conclusion the self driving cars in my perspective are a good idea but it will come with soem complications as does everythign else. This would be a huge step for the human race and would benefit alot of people. The technology will grow and the problems will become less until we have reached the point where there is no problems with the cars and their abilities.      ",4
01d6e7e,"The 'Face' on Mars is just a hoax. It seems as though the mound on this planet is just a mesa. If you don't believe me, then listen to me very closely. The very similar face on the side of Mars can be very defining but not a single astronout have researched at the Mesa up close and personal. But even if it was made by aliens, it still wouldn't tally up right?

The 'Face' was first noticed in 1976 by Viking 1 spacecraft, circling around Mars, after trying to find its sistership, Viking 2. As Viking 1 was circling around, it spotted a likeness to the human face. And the mound was found in Cydonia, a very well-know area on the Red Planet to house mesas. As the years went by, they looked more into the mound and Scientists concluded that it was just another mesa, but this moutain-like hill had shadows that resemble the human face.

As you review this very peculiar picture, you can see that it just resembles Earth, mostly in Western America. That certain part of America are very popular for its mesas and buttles (which are the same as mesas). There may be more out in the solar system, mnaybe even more in the whole universe itself, but in the end of all the discoveries, they all end up being coincidences. Maybe one day, we'll find extre terrestrial life, but for now, we will just make more and more discoveries until we don't have anything else to find.",3
01dabde,"Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down and how is it benificial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day hope to buy and all the modifications they will make to 'trick it out'. Many people though end up being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it then that. So what advantages could there be to a  world with fewer cars on the road?

The first topic that is at the forfront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, thats just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don't really need. Now I know what your thinking but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting anymore right? With public transportation becomingh more and more avalible many people are choosing to take the public bus rather then buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you pay. What you thought they went to police and teacher's wages and building nice little parks for the kiddies? Well acording the Environmantal Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted citys are even begining to put laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and placing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and matnence as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways theres a lot of dough pouring into your car drives.

Now heres the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but its still very important, the environment. Car emmisions are the second biggest source of polllution in the atmosphere, first place going to powerplants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? Its not the the planets health we're talking about here its the health of everything living on it including us. While we're on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier then ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emmisions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outside playing football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldnt if there were less cars on the road. So think of the health of your familly, your friends, your pets, and yourself.

Finally we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to carpool take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticibly prominent that car companys are trying to come up with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Citys are coming up with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and imporve safty"". So for those of you that can't stand to be left behind by the times jump on the band wagon and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.

Cars, the parasprites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emmisions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a milenia poisoning the air we breath and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to stop it now this travesty will continue to ravange all life on the planet untill we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and help to push this new trend of a car free world.

01e0bb8,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling? With this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, it is truly possible. You can detect the emotions people are feeling through this technology advancement.

Using this new technology serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other forms of technology.

To begin, the facial recognition technology serves great purpose and value because it unlocks new discoveries in our history. With this being said, new beginnings are coming about because we know more about how Mona Lisa was feeling while Da Vinci was painting this famous portrait that is spoken about all across America. It gives insight on the deeper meaning of this painting. For example, we now know that Da Vinci must have studied the human body in order to create such a wonderful piece of artwork. In the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" Due to his great knowledge of the human body and muscles he was able to paint precise emotions and because he painted such precise emotions, people today were able to unlock how she felt during this time. A new discovery. After all, this advanced tech can now bring this history piece to life. In the text it states,""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This creates a new perspective of how we view our history and it also could unlock mysteries in our histories past.

In addition,this technology advancement was created only to help people. As consumers, we always think about, what would this do for me? With that being said, the Facial Action Coding System could have a positive affect on our medicines, entertainment, and medical technology. In the text it states,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery."" The one thing I think about when I hear America is sports, which is a form of entertainment. The new technology could benefit our use of televisions and radios or smartphoneswhich we watch sports on. Another thing I think about it when someone is speaking about this country is medical purposes. Our country has amazing medical advances and technology. The facial coding could help create a better understanding or a better alternative for complicated technology. Then again, as consumers we also spend alot of time on social media or looking at ads. Sometimes there are things we are not interested in at all but they annoyingly still pop up. With the facial coding, our faces can be detected if we like the ad and if we do not like the ad. This benefits us greatly because it shows what we do want to see and what we do not want to see. In the text it states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different."" Many might say this does not matter but ads are everywhere and our world is only going to rely on computers, or other forms of technology so why not embrace it and try to advance too?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other technology. ",4

The reason why the author would want to go back to venus is to see what happend to it but the reason humans have not been back to venus in nearly 3 decades is because the rovers cant take the preassure and heat on the planet and break in 30 or less minutes.

Humans want to go so they are making prototypes of diffrent things like a blimp like vehicle that would stay 30 miles in the air that would study but the problem with tht vehicle is that no light can penetrate throw the clouds so they couldnt see anything. but they might you something called a mechinacal computer that dosnt need a battery it is operated with gears and levers so it could with stand harsh enviorments. the reason we we cant use a computer for example is because the elctronics would melt and imploud because of the emensece preassure on the surface of venus.

The electoral college is not a good idea. Voters really dont get to vote for the President . A slate of electoral is the person to elect the President. This system is called a disaster factor , the U.S. should be lucky the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. There are also people that want to stay with keeping electoral college . The electoral college restores most of the weight on the political balance that by population in large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. The canidates dont spend time in the states they know theres nochance of winning. Its a winner takes all kinda thing. In the 2000 campaign about 17 states didn't get to see there canadidates at all . States like Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campaign ad.

Here is some information on the electroral college ,Every 4 years the presidential election is held on the Tuesday after the first monday inNovember. You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President . When you vote your actually voting for your candidate's electors. The electoral college has 538 electors. 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. After the election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertinment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning canidate in your state.

State legislatures are responsible for picking electors. In the 1960's segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratice electors with new who would oppose John F. Kennedy.  in 1960 also Hawaii sent in 2 slates of electors to congress . Luckily , Vice President Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate validated his only opponet's electors.

The electoral congress should not be used it's unfair . It should be changed to be the popular vote for the president in the U.s. . It's unfair to the people there not really voting.                                      ",3

The landform on Mars is a mesa, and there are many like it on Earth. As the text states, ""It remids me most of Middle Buttein the Snake River Plain of Idaho...""

As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This means that if there were tools, construction equipment, or anything

from ""extra terrestrials"" that they would be visible in the picture. There was nothing there but landforms and rocks.

In 1998 the best picture taken was when Mars was foggy and skeptics and theorists said that markings could be hidden. But in 2001 a new picture was taken and it showed that the landform only had the markings the rest of the planet. The red dust and rocks.

The landform on mars in natural, even if it looks like a face. You can see things closeer up in a digital image, there are many equivilent landforms on Earth that are natural, and lots of theories on the face are exagerated. Before you speculate, have your facts straight.   ",4
01f5682,"Dear State Senate,

I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,  the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Paragrapgh twenty-three, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.                             ",5

That is not good imagine a (NASA) researcher going to venus to get information they would not even make it back because of how hot it is. Venus is something were people should not go. Also in the text it says that ""Venus would not allow scientists to float above the fry"". That quot from the text is very important because it is clealy warrning you that it is dangerous.

Venus is not very safe for humans/researchers. In the story it says that "" beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seekinhg to land on its surface"". Just reading that littke sentence you can tell Venus is no joke it is very dangerous. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration would not even send a human to study Venus.

In the story the author talked about sending mechanical computers to Venus to get the information they need. That would be very smart to send old technology

(Mechanical computers) insted of humans it would be way safer. In the story the author states that ""These divices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"".

So I belive that if these mechanical computers did the job back in 1940s then it can do the job now because we have better technology no then we did back then. Also it states in the story that ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicaye when it comes to extrem phisical condidtions"". If they send these computers they can really get their information andit would save more human lives because then the humans would not have to go to Venus toget the information they need.

In conclusion Venus is dangerous, its not safe for humans to go up to venus and they are thinking about sending tecnology computers to get information.",3
0210900,That technology would not help in schools because the fact that students are sometimes not happy with how computer ads put up. Teacher can also see how their students are feeling on the computer but one flaw about this is that what if it didn't work. The technology would have to have many updates to get the system right and make the experiance better. Someone can hack that computer and can be watching you or the government might be trying to watch us. How much is schools going to be paying for these compter? Maybe around a million dollars in buying and fixing it. Most schools don't have good internet or they have bad students that might break these computers and the school or stduent would have to pay for it. The computers schools have now barely even work now so why buy a computer that most likely not going to work no better than the computers they already have. Why take away a ad and putting a new ad is going to make a student happy? What if they dont like ads at all? what is the point of the putting a computer that can read people emotions by scanning their face and the students are not going get any happier they are going be excited about at first and then get bored with it. Computers are not good for kids at a young age they will get addicted to being on a computer won't go outside and then they are going to gain weight and then be fat. ,2

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. This is all I wanted to tell you , I hope you listen to what I'm trying to tell you. I know I am not the only one that thinks like this. If you would like to contact me back you could email me at EMAIL_ADDRESS. Thankyou and have a great day!

021271e,"In the article it states that a "" Long time ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today ."" This shows that Venus wasonce probably just like how earth is today . You couldve probably lived there and made a whole new life there . Also the text says "" The planet has a surfave of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This shows how Venus is just alike to earth and that maybe we should consider exploring Venus more.

The idea in the article that they came up with is that they wanted us to imagine a ""vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles abover the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level om Earth."" This is showing that humans can possibly live on Venus . Its not ""eady conditions"" to live in but they can. They should explore Venus some more and come up with a idea so people can possibly start a life there. This would benefit a lot of people because what if something really bad happened to earth then people could stay on another planet and we can have Venus as a back up plan if anything goes wrong .

In conclusion, NASA should consider exploring Venus because its would benefit a lot of people. Having another planet to live on would possibly lower the population on earth and would make it easier for everyone. It can also be a ""backup planet"" incase anything happened to the planet earth and lastly we can see how it is to live different as surive in a different planet . ",3
0220c9f,"This article about the Facial Acting Coding System could be valuable. Though it may not be exactly needed it could be used when looking at a criminal and seeing what emotions they are hiding under the fake smile or crying face they have. This facial coding system could be used to help students who are struggling and what help but cant get the nerve to ask for it. Since technology is becoming a way of life this is just another step forward to becoming closer to computers and for them to understand us better.

In paragraph 1, It showed an example of Mona Lisa. In paragraph 5 it talks about how Da Vinci would study human anatomy to help him paint facial muscles precisely to show true emotions. For them to do Mona Lisa was brilliant because everyone knows who she is and Da Vinci studied human anatomy to show strong emotions. This could be valuable to schools because students make it hard for other students to show their true emotions. By using this facial coding systen teachers and administration could see what students are truly struggling with. It could be their math homework or maybe a problem with family. They could see their emotions in the computer while at home and at school to see how they act differently. This system could make school a more welcoming and fun to place to come to. In paragraph 6 it says this computer technology could make a boring lesson more interesting to the specific student. Every student has different like so this would be very valuable to schools.

Through this all it would be valuable for schools to invest in this product because it would make the school more fun for students and allowing them to learn more by the facial system allowing them to recognize what makes them happy and what makes them annoyed or bored. It would also be valuable to buy this because students could have fun learning about it and seeing how it works and may show them what they want to do in the future by showing what the future may turn out to be with new technology.",3

I got to see Europe and China. My friend and I got to help a lot of people during our time, too. There is also time to play around on the boats after you unload all the animals. I loved to play volleyball and baseball. Also, we played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The program helped open up my eyes. It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It might be a little hard at first ,and rough, but you'll get the hang of it. After all that, just think of how good you'll feel after knowing you've helped people. Signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity for you.

0226250,"In this article Driverless Cars are coming i agree with them. It would be nice to have cars that can help us drive or even drive for us. First that would be really good for peoplewho drink and drive. Then it would be the same for

people who are tired from work or an type of activity and cant drive because there just so tired.Plus i feel its a good investment in our country, instead of getting a taxi.

First i think its a good idea because the people who drink and drive now have this driverless car to take them home. There friends dont have to worry if he or she made it home safetly cause there is this car that is

keeeping them safe from driving. They wont hurt anybody or themselves. Also if they do try to drive and put there hand on the wheel maybe they should have the car sense there is too much alchahol in there system.Like how paragraph 4 said that ""they will needed a

whole lot of sensors"" for the car so maybe then can put a sensor like that put in the car.

Then the people who are tired from work and from doing something very tiring or the people who cant see even at night

and they suufer from driving and they end up up a car crash so the car can help

them out a lot because many people suffer from not seeing in the dark when they drive. Or when you

go grocery shopping and your reallly tired and cant really much for yourself the car is there for you to take you home.

Last, its a good investment for our country in paragraph 1 they mention that

""the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibllity than a bus."" so i feel why not take up that offer when there is so many companies out there that offer a taxie system, so we can replace all of that and save more money in this counry and possibly other contries. having to pay for a ride from and back can burn your pockets when you can use half that with the driverless car. I feel you can save so much more money that way ecespically when you use the taxi sytem everyday. when you think about it thats thousands a year. So i say just invest in the car and it would be better for you and me

in the the end.

In conclusion i think that driving driverless cars are good with me im totally with it in the end.",4
0226c11,"The face on Mars is a natrual landform created on the planet. Some people believe it was created by aliens or that's an alien artifact around the planet. The face that we see in the pictures is mostly not possible for aliens to create and for sure there are no tracks of any alien life around.

In the article it says There was no alien monument after all. This explains my answer by saying that the face was created naturally and not an alien artifact. Also in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars it explains another reason to show that the face on Mars is just a natural landform created by the planet in the article it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West"". This also explains my answer by comparing the natural landforms on Earth and comparing it to the face on Mars. The third reason to explain why the face on Mars

is a natural landform is in the beginning a reason to why people think it's an alien creacted landform or artifact is because of the pictures where not made clear enough during 1976-1998. After getting the 2001 picture it's easier to see that it only creates a face when there are shadows.

The picture taken in 2001 can also make it clear that it has a natural form for example it's not perfectly shapped and it has a few cracks almost like a rock. In the article it says “As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". This explains my answer by explaining how the image taken in 2001 was a better picture of the face on Mars and they could actually work on it better and discover it without any problems to stop them along the way. Also the image taken in 2001 can help explain to those who believe that it was formed by aliens that it was a natural landform created by the planet naturally. The landform that looks like a face on Mars is created naturally by the planet. ",3
0227e67,"Cars thery're every where, and people use cars to get from point A to point B. Cars are very important in the lives of many people all over the world. Cars are efficiant and help to get the job done. People often only seem to look at jus the postive sides of cars, but yet tend to oversee the down falls of how the use of cars can have in a persons life. the use of cars many have a few postive aspects but the negatives out way the good. The use of cars effect the enviorment negatively in a big way, also the use of cars tends to cause people stress that a person might not be aware their going through. The limting of the use of cars is something people must take upoon themselves to look at.

The envorement its all around us, it provides us with the basic nesscities we need to survive the envoirment provides us with oxygen that we need to breathe and food that we need to eat. The use of cars is threating the enviorment. Cars realse Co2 or carbondioxy into the enviorment causeing the air to be come polluted. Accoriding to an article tittled ""paris bans driving due to smog"" writen by Robert Duff. Duff writes about how Paris Frances air had become so polluted due to the realse of co2 admsions  that the govenerment had to enforce a band on the use of cars until the smog in the air cleared up. The main casue of the smog in the air was the diesls found in the cars used in France, due the fact that France has a Tax policy that draws towards the use of diesles over gasoline. Accrording to Duffer ""diesels makes up  67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to53.3 percent average of diesle engins in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.""

In the article Duffer explains how the most ppopulated cities are the ones with the the smog or air pollution. Cities like Beijing and China have alot of smog in the air is because of the use of cars. The use of cars have a very negative impact on the enviorment. Countries all over the world are taking a step foward towards limting their use on cars due to effcts its has. In an acrticle called In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars writen by Elisabeth Rosenthal talks about an upscaled coummunity in called Vauban Germany where people have given up theirs cars. In Vauban's 70 percent of the families that resided in vaubans don't own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. Even though alot of the resdients of Vauband dont use car some still due. Ownig a car is still allowed vauband uses large garages where people can  store thier cars,but a person must first pruchase a parking space for $40,000 first. While some cars are still used in the comuntiy walk or bycicle as thier means of transportation. Vauband is a prime example of of a postive growing trend. Vauband helps to reduce the green house gas emissions cars give off.

While cars can cause harm to the enviorment, cars can also cause people stress that they themsleves don't know they're dealing with. Accoriding to a a qoute found in In german Suburb, Life goes on without Car. Heidrun Walter exprees how without casr lifes is happier ""When I had a car I was always tense.

022a010,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be slightly helpful, but other than that, not at all. While few would benefit from being taught by a computer, others, not so much.

Dr. Huang said that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe this is wrong, as there is no way of making a student less bored. If you were to add entertainment to the mix of the lesson, then how could the lesson be taken seriously? Teachers tend to add their own spice to lessons that, both, make the students laugh, and become more interested in the lesson. No computer could mimick a human's humor. A computer also would not be able to explain things as well as a teacher could. A computer could modify the lesson as many times as it could, but the student would still be confused. A teacher would be able to explain things better and make it simpler than a computer could. It would also be quicker.

It is proven that students learn better with paper and a physical learning environment. Sure, a computer would know more and be able to explain things more properly, but knowing this fact... Would it even be worth teaching the student if they won't even remember it? Technology would also completely replace the need to write down notes by hand. With a physical environment, you also learn life skills. For example, knowing when to speak and ask questions, manners, and getting along and working with others. These skills are often used in work environments.

And, what about those who have no access to technology? Poverty and homelessness are still big in the world. Sure, your child could participate in a physical environment at a school, but why would there be a need for schools if it is all on the computer? It would also be cheaper for school officials to have computers than to have teachers that require a weekly or monthly pay, and to not require supplies for the children as well. It would quickly spiral into a ""be rich or be homeless"" world in an instant. A lot of stress would be put on the backs of many people who wish for their child to get an education. We already give these people a hard time, why given them an even harder time, and even include their children?

In conclusion, a lot would be wrong with using the Facial Action Coding System in schools. Very few would benefit from having such advanced technology instead of teachers and a physical environment, but the rest would be disadvantaged.",5

Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys. The cowboy, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead his family to host a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet his family was very proud of him. When he turned 18 I bet he was excited because he could be drafted for miltary service. Then when his board learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to just keep doing that for service.

Another good thing about it is that you can travel around the world and the states like if there are more animals do in need because they are in danger and almost extinct!

The best part is that you go out around the world and help out everything and if you are in the news for that and the people see that you were on the news with all of you friends then they might as well congratulat you.

Once they see that people can do that to world then they might want to join because they to. When you around the world that means you might go to Asia and a lot of places that were very good in need like China,Japan,Mexico,Australia, and the best for helping out animals is probably Antartica.

People might say wow that bad because it's really cold there and that Therese really nothing we can do there but there is. You can help the endanger Penguins and sea lions that are there and bring more food for them and ever since the globe warming went up Antartica is slowly melting but then getting more snow but the heat are killing penguins. Maybe go to the polar and save some Narwhals or some other animals like polar bears.

So go around the world helping Elaphants,Penguns and also rhinos or just a lot of animals and other counterinsurgency that are helping animals and build more thing for them like China and the pandas and make more cities or homes for the homeless.

That is just one of many very well told reasons in the article that the author provided to state why we should keep studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. THe author provides information that pushes people to want to know more.

In the article the author provides us with information on the ways how humans have studied Venus. In the the article the author tells the reader how humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study Venus but no spacecraft survived for such a long time on just landing on Venus. The author expalins that that is the reason to why no furthur studies have been made in over three decades.

Another thing of information that the author provides the reader with is to why the atmosphere is challenging for us. In the article the author provided the reader with information like the degrees and pressures of the atmosphere. In the article it is said to be over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on earth. Also on the discovery on the thirty plus miles abover surface tempatures change to 170 degrees and the pressure changed close to the sea level on earth giving the impression that its survivable for humans. This discovery make scientists want to know more on why that is the case, leading them to keep making new discoveries no matter the challenges it brings them.

The last thing the author provides its readers is with imformation on what NASA is working on to know more about Venus. The author states how NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. They are working on simplified electronics which some have in fact worked and have lasted for three weeks. It has studied and has gathered more information.

023c138,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pullution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraunts and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change.""

Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the enviornment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to excercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the enviornment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to excercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.    ",4

To begin with, there were many ""disaster factors"" in the system for the electoral college. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Best-Laid Defenses of the Systems Are Wrong"", it states that back in 1960, segregationists almost succeds in putting in new electors to oppose John F. Kennedy. Also, it states that there are ""faithless"" electors that refuse to vote for their party's candidate which is pretty sad. There are more reaons why we should bann the electoral college.

Furthermore, population is a big factor also in the electoral college. ""In Defense of the electoral college: Five Reasons to Keep Our Despised Method of Choosing the President"" It states that the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance of large states. It's wrong because the big states are the ones that need that population in order for the candidate to win. It's pretty fair to do it by popuation because it depends on that specific person on which candidate is gonna win, not by the state.

That leads to the fact that electoral votes are not the same as voters voting for the president. Many presidents lost the election just because of the electoral college. Personally, it's not fair that a candidate can't become president just because of the electoral college. it even says it in ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wong"". It states that voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors that will elect the president. Nobody knows if that person is loyal or not.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be banished from this country. It is a terrible system that had many ""disaster factors"" in it and also there are people that are elected that are not loyal to their party. If we don't stop it now, who knows what will happen to this magnificent country. If we keep the electoral college as our system, maybe our country will go downhill, so r you willing to abolish it for the greater good?    ",3
024a3bb,"I think this 3-D computer software that can recognize emotions can be used very good because we could tell if somone isnt happy and when there mad ,it can be used for students when they are confuse or bored in school.

This computer software can help kids that are falling into depression not fall into it how? You could use it on them and see if they are depresse and they could recive help from adults. This can also let you know when someone isnt in the mood such as being mad or sad.

This 3-D

software can also help kids in a classroom. It can be downloaded in your computer and you could be reading a passage and your confuse,it could make the lesson modify and make it less confusing on the student. It could also be used for video games or video surgery.

This is why i think its a good idea to have this computer software because it can help students in school if there confuse or bored ,and it can help kids when there depresse and mad or just not in the mood.   ",2

Also using ''video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movments - in a real face or in the painrted face of Mona Lisa.'' It can define the emotion of a real human and in a painting. There technology is very intresting they construct a 3-D computer model to the face. instead of humans trying to find out calculations them selfs they can use the new technology. Humans can perform the same way as the new technology even tho they are gonna have to estimate the percentigs. Also can tell when children or students are tired or bored or falling as sleep so then the technolgy '' could modity the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computers-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.'' so it can keep the students on track and still learn on there school lessons and wont get behind. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emtions. Students can change there face exprishions but the new technolgy can tell that not there real expertion.

0262618,"""Unmasking the face on Mars""

You will be wondering what theirs a face on Mars,well we do not know for sure. Some scienitst are saying that the ""Face on Mars"" are provided from aliens (Aliens are living in Mars?). They discover the face in 1976,that is when they took the photo they lastest image is from 2001. Also another scientist are saying (am one of them) that ""It is just a rock"". It has natural grow & its not a mask & just a rock. But who knows no one knows.

Did you know that 50% of scientist think that it is a mask from aliens & the other 50% of scientist think it is just a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveilded the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation. . .which resembles a human head. . .formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes,nose & mouth."" And i still think it just a rock,if it were an aliens face or an human face tell me how did it got their.

Do you still think that its still their (i do so) because it is a rock,rocks dont die,they are hard rocks we have & they never die. But am not that convience how can a rock change by its years,but also maybe because it is a different type of rock (its in the space) I thinking that the rock changes by the time.

Its just a rock that looks strange dont all rocks look strange they are all unique & some strange ones they are a lot of type of rocks in the life,dont think the the rocks are the same. Were different.",2
026355a,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you may get to see new sights. You may also play fun and exiting games while your off shift or while going on the return trips. You can also help out with fun things like feeding the animals or be put on night shift.

The sights you get to see could be amazing. The thing you get to see could be amazing. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see all types of new things like new fish or new landscapes. Some off the landscapes you might not be used to, but that means that you could enjoys the veiw! As your out on the sea you can see fish that you might of never seen before. You could also see reefs that are colorful and bright!

When your on the ship it could get quite borning. You might want to do something fun. Well on the return trip you get to play all the games etc. you want. Some games for when your in the mood for somehting sporty you can play baseball and volleyball where their are empty holds where the animals were kept. You can also play table tennis, fencing, and boxing. After you played the sports you might be ready for a relaxing game such as board games or cards. If your not into those kinds of things then you can just read or whittle. There is always a fun option.

When there are tons of animals on the ship there is always work to be done. To help out you can feed the animals and/or clean their stalls. You could also pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. When you feed the animals you have to feed and water them 2 or 3 times a day. To be extra helpful you could help clean. It may not be the funnest job, but it helps a lot. When we get to our destination there are tons of animals to load off the ship. You coild help unload them or if we are back at our returning place you could help load the animals and all the supplies into the ship.

Those are only some of the reansons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Its a lot of fun, but it can be hard sometimes. You may get hurt, but thats okay. Thanks for your time.",4
0264158,"In the article,""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there is an abdunant amount of reasons why these cars with the idea of driveless cars is absolutly absurd. The idea for the car itself is a ton of money just to build it. Then to add ""smart-roads system""(3) would add thousands of more dollars to go to waste. If the money issue is not a concern, then what about the idea of still having to assist a car that is suppose to be ""driverless""?

The cars themsevles would cost a fortune to make but ""smart-roads systems""(3) would cost too much money for anyone person to pay. Now the car itself would be too much money because of the need of so many sensors. With an estimated guess, there would have to at least 11 different types of sensors to be place in one car. Even with thousands of dollars going into the driverless cars, they still have not found a way to have a completely driverless vehicle. Different cars call for different driver's assistance. Some ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel,""(7) while others will send a signal to the driver such as, vibrating the seat, announcing to driver that they ""should be prepared to take over""(7), and others have flashing lights. Which means that in no way is this car driverless if it some how requires the drivers help with driving.

These cars would cost one person, a lot of money that they do not have. Even the safe-road system that has not even been made would cost even more then the car itself. If that was not enough, then what about the fact that these cars are not driverless... the driver still needs to help driving. These reasonings just help with the understanding that these cars is just something that is not needed in this world.",3
0269b85,"The picture shows a face but how long ago was that picture taken, 1976 was when the first picture was taken. In 1976 they had a camera with pixels thats not so good. The picture was taken like there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gound or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were. It was taken 43 meters away.

In 1998 the picture was taken again and the camera was getting better and better. The 1998 picture looks more clear then the pitcure that was taken in 1976. Over time the picture got more clear. 2001 the picture was taken again and it was taken 2.5 km-wide stripes away. This time it didnt even look like a face. The Middle Butte looks like a snake from in the air but doesnt make it a snake. You saying aliens made that too the way the water moved made it like that .

So facts show that at one point it looked like a face but wasnt done by alien the way the picture was taken is the reason why. You could use the moon as an example. Everyone use to think there was a man in the moon just by the way it looks but clearly there isnt a man in the moon.

0273b7b,"Venus is often referred to as the ""twin"" of earth. It is the second closest planet to the sun. Space crafts have been sent to Venus despite its extreme conditions. There has not been any humans sent to Venus. The last spacecraft was sent was three decades ago. Spacecrafts have not lasted more than a few hours after landing in Venus.

The author of this article suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Astronomers and scientists are fascinated by Venus because it is the most similar planet to Earth. In the article it states that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus has some features that are the same to those of Earth. Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters. Mars and Venus are the closest planets to earth and often times Mars is closer than Venus. Due to the speed, it changes which two planets is closest.

NASA is working on technology that would allow further studying on Venus. One of their solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. This means that they would have something that could fly over the many storms to avoid the bad conditons. This idea is more thought out than the spacecrafts that would have to land and would only last a few hours. Another one of NASAs projects is simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

The author does have some convincing details in the article. Though the conditions of Venus do seem harsh and there has not been anymore attempts to send more projects down to Venus in three decades. It does seem like NASA is working hard to get things fixed and ready for a possiblity of sending projects down. The details presented were convincing and it makes a good article. The author is pursuading but the conditions that Venus holds are not convincing.       ",3
0279487,"When cars where made by humans they put this device that is to have the car be more alarmed to the driver and everyone else that is in the car, but there are still some cars that are very old and don't have the same menufactors that are placed in the old cars that are like 1800s and 1900s. I think that the old cars should be put into some car meuseum or somthing to remind us how the very first engine car ever work without having a carage that has to have a horse to use as wheels even though that was a very very very very very very long time before even engine cars even excisted in time.

i think that we've impoved on the safety of everyone that is driving and that are still learning to drive and trying our hardest to keep people safe from harm but useally that doesn't happen, we would have some difficulties with the cars that we are using today still needs some work to be done with them. I think it's a good idea to put more control on the car and less for the driver that has to drive the car. The only reason why we build cars and buses and trains and etc is to make us get to things like a if your running late for something and you need to get there really fast you could take your car and get there as fast as you can so your not offically late and not get fired and have to lose your job cause you were late for work.

That's why we have cars to rely on and not our feet the whole time but most times if we dont want to use our car we can always walk there thats somewhere close and not far to walk like the gas station or the park or anything or if your just to dang ""LAZY"" to even walk that far then you would use a car or if you dont own a car you always use the bus to go where you want to go. It's not that hard to spend a little money on a bus toll to get to where you want to go and really it's not that hard at all but if it's for something really important then ""GO BUY A CAR"" i mean yeah cars are exspenive to even afford one but really if you save money then wouldn't have no problem at all on buying a car that has to fit your needs and get to places that you need to go.",1

Even though many scientists thought the Face was a alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet. People may have thought the Face was bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence the NASA would rather hide.

The face was just a huge rock formation which looked as to be a human head. The head was formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia.

The places you can go such as Europe now thats kind of odd. Of why you you would go in a cattle boat fulled with people you dont know. I'm not saying I would turn down that opportunity but I would think about it for awhile. You dont know where you going to be next you may get a hint or something i wouldn't know but it would be scary if it where myself doing this.

When would you get home? I would always ask myself this quistion if it were me on a cattle boat going to Europe .

Also what was the main reason why I took this opportunity. Was the main reason because it was opportunity of a lifetime. Think it over and find 3 main reasons why you took this opportunity.

I understand why Luck did what he did. What im trying im trying to say here is why he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II. What I dont unnderstand is what was his main reason.

To finish up my dissagrement of why someone like me or even you shouldent do this is, did he even help anybody becaue in the promt it didn't tell wither or not if he did. I would think that was that was the most important thing.            ",2

0293f31,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great achivement in science and technology, but should it be used in your computer at school? There are many reasons why using this coding systam could be a great thing in the class room, or a disaster. As stated in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if we could put this in our everyday school computers, it could calculate whether or not a student is having trouble with a lesson and change it for them to help them. What are the pros? What are the cons?

Some of the pros to using this coding system in students computers is as stated in the article, it could read the studens facial expresssions and determan if he or she is confused or having trouble understanding the lesson. If it could do this it could change the way the lesson it tought better helping the student understand.

But what if schools dont teach lessons online. For example, my school does not teach lessons online. Our teachers might give us website addresses to look up and use for studying, depending on the teacher. Unlike other schools around me that do E-learning. They either stay at home, or go to school and do a whole days work off of their school issued computers. This Facial Action Coding System would work greatly for those students that do E-Learning, but not so much for the ones that don't.

Secondly, does this system cost anything? If so how much? And do schools really need to spend extra money on a system to be installed in our computers? Schools have gotten along just fine without this for years. Schools did just fine before they were even using technology like computers in the first place. I don't think that we are really in need of something like this. Students using the internet to do assigments always ask questions if they have any. Those students also have internet acsess if they are working on online assignments, so they could also search for more websites to help them better understand.

Another topic listed in the article was using the coding systam to learn if that person was intrested in an add that showed up on their computer or not. I belive that adds are already annoying enough, I do not want a coding systam reading my face and giving me adds that I would be more intrested in. Doing so would distract that person from trying to get their work done. For example, if I was a student scrolling through a website I am using to fill out an assignment for school, I don't want a bunch of adds poping up distracting me from my work. Espesially when its and add that intrests me. If its something that intrestes me, then I'm more likely to click on it distracting me from my work. I sertanly wouldn't want that to happen, and I belive nobody else does either.

Really there are a lot of great points to both sides of the topic, but it is mainly up to the schools if they want to use The Facial Action Coding System or not. They only need to ask themselfs the right questions. Do our teachers teach offline alot? Do we have the money for technology like this? And do our students really want to use this or not?                ",3
0296469,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the aouthor presents two both possitive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In which i found that a driverless car would not be a good idea. I found this to not be a well thought out plan due to the technology could fail, the cars can't navigate through work zones or around accidents and human drivers would eventually get bored of sitting there and doing nothing and would want to eventually drive.

First, thing that would be on anyones mind about being in a car that you can not fully control is what if an accicdent was to accour or the car's systems began to fail? Who would be blamed the driver or the company that produced the car? In the article the author states that ""...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fualt- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This proving that when the laws are changed the person whom is at fualt may not at all be fair since it could have been the manufacturer's fualt and not the driver.

Second, reason why driverless cars would not be all the great is because the cars can not navigate throught work zones and accidents, so what goood would a driverless car be when it can not even navigate around everyday issues. In the story it states ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This showing hwo the driverless cars won't be complettely driverless which would then compleicate things for certain drivers and, or the manufacturers in case of a navigation error.

Lastly, drivers would eventually get bored of just not doing anything and would want to drive but would not be able to because there cars would be self driven. Inthe article on paragraph 8 it states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?..."" This evoctaing how not only would you get bored while waiting since you can do other things while in the car if you have to drive and you are doing somthing which you can't automaticlly take over it could cause and accident and it would not be at all safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea due to the fact that the technology could fail and then who would be at fualt may be a problem or simple unfair. The cars can not go through work zones or accidents so why would you want a driverless car that you still have to drive in case of something like that. Thirdly, drivers would be bored waiting for there turn to drive and if they were to do something else and could not automaticlly take conrol that could cause issues for themselves and other drivers. So why would you want a self-driven car when driving so such so much more fun and better?   ",3
02a059f,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

belives that exploring Venus is a worthy challenge despite its challenges. Based on how they have written this article I can say the that the author succeeded at laying out his claim and evidence.

The author starts off by stating facts about the star in our sloar planet from nicknames, temperature, as well as atmoshpere. The text states "" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"". the author also states "" on the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet"".

Later on in the passage the author starts to ask the reader a

questions and provides answers to them. The text sates"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, then why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"". and answers with "" Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"". This body paragraph is another eason why I believe that the author provided a good claim.

The author then continues to NASA's ideas on further exploring the harsh surfaces of Venus. The suthor states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"". Then gives more detail about the process. The text states"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"".

The author then discusses the problems about the idea that NASA has come up with and the other possible solutions for exploring Venus's harsh surface. The passage states"" peering at Venus from a ship or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limit insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffectve. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". The author also states"" NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have laster for three weeks in such conditons. another project is looking back to an old technolgy called mechanical computers"".

Based on the information that i have presented from the author's claim and passage, shows that this claim and evidence is correct and is a valid statement to be made by the author.             ",4
02a1298,"The technology shows positives for human emotions. The Technology mesaures muscle movement, emotion, and how different emotions can be mixed with other emotions. Technology is changing the future to be exactly like a Human and be able to read a Human.

The artical says this in paragrapgh 3 lines 2-3 ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like Human musles. The technology can sense six basic types of emotion. The technology will associate each movement of the muscles with the emotion that would match that certain muscle movement.

emotion is a big part of the human body and so are facial expressions. ""Dr. Paul Eckman""and ""Dr. Huang"" have created a technology to read these emotions. These technology can read emotion from even people that show very low degree of emotion. The mona lisa created by Da Vinci was created to show human emotion. But the mona lisa isnt just happy because she is smiling. The mona lisa shows a whole bunch of emotions and this is saying is that any human can seem like they are happy or sad but really they can be the exact opposite.

02a1c3a,"I honestly think driverless cars are an excellent idea. They could help drivers out a lot and possibly change transportation forever. There are a couple reasons why I believe driverless cars should happen. The first one is that driverless cars will make it easier to travel long distances. That reason is followed by the fact it'd be easier to drive if you have small children in the vehicle. And the last reason I have on why driverless cars should become popular is that there will be a lot less accidents.

The first reason I believe driverless cars should become popular is that it could make traveling long distances a lot easier than it always has been. With a driverless car, you wouldn't have to stop and take breaks due to you being tired. This would reduce the time it took to reach your destination. With the car being able to drive itself, you also wouldn't have to stop and sleep. The car could work on getting you to where you'd like to go and you could get back in control after you were well rested. I know these things seem dangerous and impossible, but I'm sure driverless car companies could come up with things to alert you if need be. Vibrating seats or a loud announcement would be good ideas on how to wake a driver if they are needed.

Another reason I'm convinced driverless cars are great is because it would be a lot easier to drive with small children. While the car is operating itself, you could look back and check on the kids a couple times. If the children were in absolute need of anything, you could take care of it while the car took care of all of you. If, by chance, you're needed to drive while your attention is focused on the children, the car could let you know. Like I said previously, vibrating seats or a loud announcement would work perfectly to get your attention but flashing lights or something like that could work as well.

The last reason I strongly believe that driverless cars are incredible is that there would be a huge decrease in traffic accidents. The driverless cars will always obey traffic laws, (proper steering, accleration, braking). People won't have to worry about drunk drivers as much either, with the car doing most of the work the driver won't be doing anything really. There's also no possible way for a car to be drunk. The last reason I have on why driverless cars would prevent accidents is that you wouldn't have to worry about bad weather unless the car needed you to navigate. Thick snow, rain, sleet or foggy windshields would no longer be an issue if cars could drive themselves.

I firmly believe in driverless cars changing the ways of transportation for good. Driverless cars can make it easier to travel long distances, uncomplicate driving with small children, and prevent vehicular accidents. Without the complications of driving when it isn't the best choice, transportation will be more simple for everyone.",4

'It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover thier food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).' As stated in paragraph 2.

'UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.' As stated in paragraph 2. Luke had made nine trips in two years of ""service."" Luke says in paragraph 5 that ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured am excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China

You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go. 'It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.' Luke had slipped down a ladder and broke a couple ribs, so, he could not do very much heavy work.

'Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gmaes also helped pass the time.'

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun! It sounds like if I were one I would be pretty amazed and entertained. It opens up the world to you. Luke says in paragraph 9 ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thir needs."" So give it a try. See if you like it. But remember this job requires much hard work and a lot of effort. Hope you enjoy it.",3
02a7cff,"Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions and how easy is for humans identify emotions from another person face to face.

Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because is a new system that is been using with anatomical information to make it easy to identify every single people just looking at some exactly angles on their face. In the text it states, ""...studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" The text also states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. So comouters need to understand that, too."" The text finally states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for videogames or video surgery."" Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotion because humans uses nonverbal communication every single moment like, if they saw something that they don't like or they don't prefer there face use to make some gestures that even the person don't even know that make that face that had express his/her emotions. The coding that this new computers have his so amazing because demostrates how technology had been make and evolution in so many people and not only people also around the world. But this kind of techology also is not the best because it put your identity in danger because the emotions that you make the computer stores all the emotional expressions and maybe with the time another people will have or find access to this archives.

Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because the face is something that reveals how humans feel just looking at your ayes or your mouth, the face cannot hide nothing. In the text it states, ""It's allabout those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" The text also states."" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" The text finally states, "" To an expert, faces dont't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human expressions because sometimes people likes to be alone when they feel sad, so they likes like to text with other people but the only thing they are looking at is the computer. The computer may been seen how the person is feeling because looks at some exactly angles on their faces to identify they real emotinal expressions of that moment when nobody is looking at them and may stores them so the computer have and example how the person faces looks like when is sad, happy or angry and also when the person is smiling and the smile is force because when a smile is forces always will look like very diferent because the muscles are making other movement, very different when the smile is spontaneousand real.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because have the carateristics that make it unique to identify emotionals expressions and that will be not possible if the help of science will not be there to support this new technology and give some advices to make this possible and valuable for the scientists and the people that are using it to take advantage or for something really helpful witch may be the case for some people that hide their emotions, this technology can be a treatment for them that can show they are not the only ones and with that problem and it is normal but they have to be happy with this new technology that can help them.

02a9d14,"Hi, my name is Luke Bomberger and I'm a Seagoing Cowboy. My experiences have been great. I've visited many places, met new people, and got to see and learn about new things. It's great and I really recomend it to you. You should give it a shot and see how things go.

I got to see the Acropolis in Greece! They were made to honor the Greek gods and are on a big hill, above the whole city. It was wonderful. Although, the gongola ride in Venice, Italy was probably my favorite. It was like a mini cruise in the city streets!

I loved helping out with the animals on the ship. The slippery ladder scared me, but it was totally worth it. Don't break your ribs on the way down like I did. Ouch.

We got to play sports on our free time, which made it even better. There were many things to choose from, such as: baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. We also read, which helped us pass time.

Again, I recomend this job for you. I am greatful for this opportunity. You will enjoy it if you like adventures. Oh, the places you'll see. The things you will do. They're great. So give it a try and tell me how it works out. Thanks! ",3
02ab5d2,"One car, one life, one big accident. That is all the future is asking to develope by continuing to try to improve and inspire people to use ""driverless cars"". I do not think driverless cars should ever become a new big thing for many reasons. They can malfunction on you. They still need assestence if they cant handle a road situation. They might not update any new laws or road changes nearby. There is so many negative reasons and thoughts that appear when thinking about the development of driverless cars.

My first reason to why I am against driverless cars is because they can always malfunction. What if it doesnt see an animal in the road and runs it over will it stop to help, would it starting loosing control? Who knows because your not the one behind the wheel. You could have stopped and saved that poor animal, instead you let your car take control. Also what if it just shuts down? Turns off completely in the middle of the road. All electronics have a point in time where they are slow and slowly begin to shut down. How long would you have the car to keep? Do you think a driverless car can last you up to 10 years? Maybe if your lucky. The weather and the technology cant keep up and hold its together as long as a gas opperated automobile is. What if it doesnt let you take control because it malfunctions and you end up hurting someone? Like it says in the text ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?

Also, what even is the point to have an automotive that still needs you in the car. If its not smart enough to drive without needing your assistence it would be useless. So say you are driving down the street and your texting and letting you car drive on its own. All of a sudden it crashes and hurts other including yourself. It would still be your fault even though you was not the one driving. In other words if you get in a car accident would the police put your car in jail or you? Well you offcorse if your even recovered from the crash your car has put you in anyways. Driverless cars allows drivers to think they can keep their eyes off the road when all reality they have to pay attention and be alert. If you have to have your eyes remained on the roads at all times then you might as well drive, atleast you will be secure and more alert.

Finally the car over all is just a big mimic. People are tying to develope objects with human like qualities. In the text it even says ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Personally I believe being human is special and an automobile can never be as special as a human life. Yes we may love our cars but never as much as one would love there children, friends, or family.

Driverless cars are just an overall bad idea and we should keep our state safe and the people in it. I'm not the only one who agrees. Driverless cars are illegal in most states. In the text it mentions ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" This shows that im not the only one who belives they are not safe and no matter what upgrades and assumptions that are made will not make a driverless car a good idea. Lets be original and stick to the safe way lets avoid the one car, one life, one accident.              ",5
02b6da9,"i think that technology is valuable because you can tell when peoples expressions show they have a emotion like when their eyebrows go up their surprised or if their lips tighten up their angry so that's really cool because you can tell when their mad, sad,happy and thats how people can tell someone is having a bad day or just sad over something really bad so thats why i agree cause i always wanted to know what people are feeling.

this evidence i got it from the article saying that thieir having technology where you can tell what people are feeling inside of them or if their mad at you or other stuff so its really cool that they invented this technology cause now people can see peoples emotions and we could never do that.

the whole point of this article is about inventing a technology where everyone can tell what your emotions are and what your body expresses those are your emotions and thats how people know what your are expressing.",1
02c0440,"The author suortts both ideas it the text he thinks that its smart that people whant to go visit Venus but at the same time he thinks that its very dangers to go too venus. Venus is like earths twin venus haves that same shape, and they even think that venus youse to look like earth. Venus just have diferint was of being its salf like the acid rain, hot temperatures, and even its crazy weathers. I still think that trying to learn about differient plants is not right becuses us as people doint even know adout are oun plant. I still think that we have a lots of time till earth becomes like Veunus.

In the text the author is trying to tail us that "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth is terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in destance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."" Are people in NASA havent even found a way to land in Venu. From the text

""Each preious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship had touched down on Veunus in more than three decades."" Even for a perion to be there is too dangrues the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fehrenheit. I even think that that we could not live there in Venus cuse of the climates. From the text shown that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly surface acid in Venus's atmosphere.""

Venus's is plant is formed just like earth But just with too much on it. strate from the"" Beyon high pressure and heat, Venusian geologgy and weather present additional impedimments like eruoting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to prodes seking to land on its surface.""

02c1ebd,"I believe that the possible use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is indeed valuable because it can really change how teachers teach the lesson plan, by showing which students auctually know what they're doing and which students are confused. It can also show which students are board and lets teachers know that they need to make the lesson more interesting.

But I do believe that it can go farther than just the class room, the school counclers can use this to tell if someone is having issues or just a bad day. If the student is upset or angry, the counclers could help them by just knowing how they feel. It can also allow the resource room teachers to better understand how their students are feeling and how to help them.

This could help teachers ease up on the work load given to students by showing them how stressed some students are when given a lot of homework, and it can tell teachers when a student is not paying any attention. This can rebuild the relationship between students and teachers by allowing teachers to better know their students needs and limits, as in how much homework they can efficiently get done with out stressing about it. This can also help teachers push back tests by knowing who isn't getting it, or having less things on it because the students are understanding the materal.

I honnestly believe that FACS really is valuable when reading the emotional expressions of students in the class room by; telling the teacher who needs help, also telling the teacher who is board and how stressed the students are, by telling the resourceroom what their students are feeling today and how to adapt to that, and by helping the counclers by showing them who needs to get something off their chest.

I really do believe that this will auctually help students and teachers in the very near future.",3
02cbcbc,"There are many different negavtives and positives when it comes to driverless cars. Knowing the goods and bads about these special cars can be good for the future when investing in one some day. Having a car that can drive itself, communicate with you and your actions, interact with how you drive could be a good thing. What if something was to go wrong? Being able to know how these things works and whats good and not so good about them could, never know, save your life.

These new and improved cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. it goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these self-driving cars many dont know. Gm had developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in a danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Today, we don't exacly know how or what these self-driving cars are going to have in them or how they may run in the future. There are many positive things that have come upon us when investigating in this new invention but what could possibly go wrong? During the making of these cars there is a lot of technology and a whole lot of sensors. While driving thses cars, lets say on the highway, and something was to go out or mountfunction. Yes, it could happen to any vehicle in the world. The only problem is if the car itself is driving and something was to happen would the driver be able to take control or would the car freeze everything up an something bad happen? Google, BMW, and anyone else involved in this think of all the good possible things but there could be so many negatives that could really be lifechanging.

My opinion on Diverless cars is good for the most part. Say you have to drive a long ways and you need a break from driving, the car could take over instead of having to stop at night and drive for you. Its crazy to think that in a few years these cars could become our lives. ""Telsa has projectd 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" ( Driveless Cars are Coming.)

So, as you think more about it, most positive things could also be negative things when it comes to self-driving cars. In a few years havinng these cars could change our lives or make them harder. From the cars driving a half a million miles to having gadgits to help you focus on driving to not so much the technology problems that could cause bad news for a lot of people. Never know, one day we might have cars driving us around instead of us driving them.",4
02cd88d,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, that's a really smart idea right?. The software can see your emotions, six emotions, and facial muscles.

First, the person who made this software was Prof. Thomas Huang, the Beckman institute fro Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who started to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The first subject he wanted to do was Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Your maybe thinking how do u use a software just to find out how someone is feeling well...

In fact, the computer takes the model of the picture or what ever is there,but it must have human muscles in the picture ir 3-D model the human muscles is called ""acton unit"". It only takes in the model if it see's it have forty-four major muscles like a human would have. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman has classified for the software to have six emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness.

Dr. Thomas Huang and his worjkers or friends that helped him with the software made six basic emotins that the human muscles have and made it to where it only workd if it have the 3-D effect with fourty-four human facial muscles witch is every smart.                              ",1

The Facial Action Coding System is a computer software creater of Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the Unviersity of Illinois. That can calculate emotions based of all fortity four major muscles from the human face and classified them as six emotions Happiness, surprise , disgust, fear , and saddness.

For many students it'll be a great experience to open up to the science world to learn further more about the human emotions based of your facial muscle. ""The facial experssions for each emotion are universal"" from Dr. Huang.

It's been founded that the great picture of Mona Lisa painting of Lenardo da Vinci. That Mona Lisa in the art was eighty three percent happy, nine percent digusted , six fearful and 2 percent angry. It's interesting for people to know such little detail from a great iconic peice from old history, where the Mona Lisa was really intended to bring smile to us.

This reaches out for students for are open up in the science world learning about the functions of Prof. Thomas Huang computer software. The computer targets risorius and zygomatic if a smile isn't being truthful of ones smile.

genuinely working on your smiles that help you smile more in a better happy mood.

In concluison the Computer facial emotion scanner is a big vaulable learning for students to learn about the invention of Prof. Huang. Many will know more futher behind the laws of the muscles of facial emotions based of the FACS (Facial Action Coding Sytem) and learn to scan are emotions.   ",2

02d481d,"Dear, Senator

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that  the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they  might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.    ",6
02d8dd2,"The use of cars today in our modern world is crazy! Everywhere you look there's cars; going down the road, parked in a garage, or on TV. Now think of a world without them...it would be different, wouldnt it? Yes, indeed it would be, the world would be less hectic and cleaner place to live.

First, Life without cars would make life much less hectic. In Vaunban,Germany there is an upscale community where there are no cars. People either walk, ride bikes or take the public tram. A servey shows ""70 precent of Vanuban's families do not own cars, and 57 precent sold a car to move here"". People move to Vauban to enjoy a ""car-free""...stress free life. ""Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (sorce 1 paragrah 3) The ""car-free"" world of not having to worry about car payemrnt, incerance, and gas money is a whole lot better than a car dependent world.

Second, Limiting our car use would help make this planet cleaner. Pollution issues have gotten so bad that ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". (Source 2 paragraph 10) In paragraph 14 it states that ""after five-days of intensive smog...the smog rivaled Beijing,China, which is one one of the most polluted cities in the world"". France uses more diesel than gasoline, therefore making up 67 precent of all vehicles in France. The use of these harsh fossil feuls is a huge problem that can help be controlled by limiting our use of automobiles.

Third, Although some may argue that we need cars to fuction in our modern world, there are other options that we can choose. For example, If everyone took public transportation such as the subway we would be cutting back tremenously on the amout of feul consumed. Another advantage of using other forms of transportation other than a car would be that you wouldnt have to worry about your car not starting, or not having enough money too fill your tank. Other forms of transportation would always be reliable and convenent. You would also feel good about helping the enviornment by not adding extra gases to the ozone.

To finish up, Limiting our use of cars would make life easier and cleaner. In source 3 it states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many people are convinved that a ""car-free"" life would be much nicer than the hectic car-consumed life we've all grown so accustom too. Limiting our use of cars is a good idea for our stressful lives.    ",4

First off, you can help people in need. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you help people that just came out of war, so they need help to get back on their feet. When you get there can be assigned a person you can help and hel them. The person your helping can be very nice, you might even become friends with them. Besides, they fought for your country, at lease helping them would be nice.

Secondly, you can visit many places you haven't seen. Have you ever wanted to go some where but didn't have the time to, well becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you can. For example, when I was helping people I got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also, visited Venice, Italy on my to China. One more place I visited was Panama Canal also on my way to China. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy gives you the once in a life time opportunity to see and go places where you might never get to go again.

Last but not least, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you can have a varity of things to do. When I was on the boat I was assigned to help my aunt Katie on her farm.

02dabc0,"Do you think theres a real alien artifact on mars? Well if you do, im sorry but there isn't. Even thoe ""the Face on Mars"" may look like an alien artifact, is just a natural land form. There are many of these in Cydonia and they're called Martian mesas. This Martian messa looks as if it's a face because of its unusual shadows that creat the illusion of eyes, a nose and a mouth.

In April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michale Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture, that is 10 times sharper than the orignal one tooken by Viking 1, of the face on mars. This picture finally revield that there was no face on mars, but a natural landform.

This didn't satisfi many people. They thought the alien markings where hidden by a haze, since that was the time of year where that part of mars gets clody. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor took a final look. Then, when they finally found it Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

What this thing actually is is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" which are landforms common around the American West. This was simply a chance for NASA to get a little money.                                      ",2

All he cares about is Seagoing Cowboys he want to be one. Well maybe if he is one then he might actullay be happy. He wants to be a Seagoing Cowboy he wants to be a good person thats all he wants in his life. He likes to watch the seagoing Cowboys and he like to hear it he might want to be a helper.

Luke he is a good person he likes the Seagoing Cowboys which is nothing bad at all he likes what he likes so that what he does.

02f131c,"This face on mars? Not exactly a sign of aleins. We can prove it. How you might ask? Well its simple if it were made by inteligent creaters would it probably still be ther. Well yes it would. Unless it were like a carnival and it travled around. But it was a giant rock. In this paper im going to prove to you that this face was not made by ""aliens"".

Twenty five years ago we found what looked like a face on mars. We didnt know if this were something caused by aliens or just something that was natural. Well that was untill we came back to take more pictures of this so called ""face"". We came back around twenty two years later. Just to find out we caught the face at the right time when we took the first picture. We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.

But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.

So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time. We realeased it so we could sow you guys we may have found something. Now we have proven that we didnt find anything. We can also tell you the ""Aliens"" didnt destroy anything because this rock is still there.

This artilcle was givin to you to prove that aliens didnt cause this ""face"". We know that there are no aliens on mars. Here in 2016 we have rovers up on mars we know nothing is up there. I was using the article to prove my theroy up above. and how could you think that a giant face is caused by aliens? People. I dont know what goes through there mind sometimes. So Thank you for reading and have a nice day.

02f14c6,"The face is just a natrual landform. In the article it says that NASA'S Viking 1spacecraft was just circleing around the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption notedd a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The aunthors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

The so called 'Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASSA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Although few sientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Plant in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars

Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Iidaho,"" says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heeight as the Face on Mars."" With this imformation you can include that the monument was just a landform, not anything mind blowing.",4
02f6c8a,"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution. ",5
0302537,"I am for the development of driverless cars. I think it would be cool if we had cars that did the work for us. They are just like smart phones in a way. However I don't think we should completely have no control over the car. People may start thinking that they can do whatever while the driving is in progress. That is not the case. Drivers should still pay attention to the road as if they were normally driving. Driverless cars will benefit us in a positive way.

One reason why i am for driverless cars is for the disabled people who can't drive like others can. Those people deserve a way to get around town too. Another reason why i think having driverless cars is a good idea is because of the simple fact that it is an option. People can buy a driverless car but still take over if they want to or need too. Another good reason for having driverless cars is for long distance drives. Sometimes flying a plane to a far destination is too expensive but if a car could take people long distance to where they need to go without themselves having to drive such a long way it would be more easier for themselves. The only concern with driverless car would be ""Who is at fault"" but that could be easily depicted i'm sure.

Driverless cars would benefit us greatly. It shows no harm to anybody who would like to have no driver. For all the reasons previously stated it is a good idea to have driverless cars. After all, it is our decision to make whether or not we want to have driverless cars. ",3

The sensors could go bad while your driving it some were and it breaks down on you. Wouldnt drivers get borewd waiting for there turn to drive?

If the driverless car comes out, what kind of different laws will be made for the car? What will the top speed be for the driverless cars? How much would it cost to replace the sensors? How will the car kno where to take you to your destination? How long will the car last be in driverless mode? Will it be operated off gas or electricity?",1
0307ec7,"The electoral college may seem like its a good idea to keep thngs going,but I think America should get rid of it. Alote of people say its unfair. Mostly because of the winner-take-all system. If you were to vote for a presedent, you are in favor, everyone would like thier vote to be counted,right? and it is,but is it really counted towards the presedent we want to get voted for elections?

According to this article, you dont really vote for the presedent you want, what you are really voting on is a state of elector, and if he gets elected he is the one who really gets to vote for the precedent. And that is unfair, I think we should change it to popular vote. We should change it to polular vote because the elecoral college is really unfair to Americas citizens. Also alote of people argue about the winner takes all system because candidates dont spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. Also it is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

Like I said it is unfair, outdated, and irrational,with all these things I dont think many people would like that .So I think we should change it to popular vote, i think it would be easyier and it would be more fair,and that is what our citizens want. And that is what we should give them. After all its thier vote that counts, so lets let them decide if we should keep it the same with the electoral college or change it to some way better like by popular vote.

so according to all this information I think we should change our way of voting and flip everything around to something fair and effective. We need somthing that would make our vote count. somthing that would be fair to all of our citizens. after all its what we choose then thats what we ned to be happening. only you can prevent unfairness.

Even thought alien are real the face that the scientists descrided was like a human face, ""Which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""(Paragraph 3). By the look of the face it already gives us a lot of information that it's a human face.

It also said that it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh on paragraph 2, ""Only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"". Almost every evidence showed that it was formed in a human face. Even thought some scientistic belived that the face was an alien artifact they can't prove it.

030cf8b,"In as small of a community as the Florida Keys, it is harder than it seems to unify us. yes we have sandbar sunday and woofstock but what else could we do on a daily basis that could unit us? As a community, if we were to limit car usage it would unit the community, decrease polution, and decrease the ammount of stress oon people. Making our community better is just one small step to making the world a better place.

Living in the keys, we all know that when the snowbirds come down traffic builds up to where it is not even moving. If we were to limit the car usage and say that on Mondays, Wensdays, and Fridays you had to either car pool or use public transportation it would unit us as a community. According to Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times Company,this year in Bogota, Colombia the city of 7 million went a day with out cars to promote alternative transportation(Selsky, paragraph20). Selsky also taked about how two other cities joined in, Cali and Valledupar,and how they helped generate a revolutionary change(25-26).Also according to Elisabeth Ronsenthal, a New York Times writer,"" ...The Internet makes telecomuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet forends""(Ronsenthal, paragraph 35).This just goes to show that no matter how big or little your community is, a day without cars might just be what you need to unify your community.

Along with beautiful clear waters, we also have our share of polution lingering in our mangroves and in our bay. Polution can be anything from a peice of garbage to smog in our air that is slowly suffocating our native plants. Even though down here we dont have a lot of smog, we still have to be awear of it and what it is doing to our neighboring communities. According to Elisabeth Ronsenthal,from the New York Times, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States""(Ronsenthal, paragraph 5). Also according to Robert Duffer,from the Chicago Tribune,""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city""(Duffer, Paragraph 10). If we want to keep our beautiful water clean we should consider going to a limited car use schedual.

Lastly, by chosing to inforce a limited car use day it would decrease the stress in our community making it even more like paradise. According to Andrew selsky,""'It's a dood opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife(Selsky, paragraph 24). Also other sientist have proven that daily excersise can reduce stress levels caused when a hormone is relised while you excersise.

In conclusion, by reducing or limitincar use for a day you can unify your community, help decrease polution, and decrease your stress levels.             ",3
0318358,"Driverless cars would be cool, but they're not safe enough to have around. The drivers have nothing to do, the driverless feature in the car could get messed up, or even the things that alert the driver that it's their turn to drive. There are so many dangers to having driverless cars, this is just a few.

For example when all the driver has to do is sit there, it will be takenadvantage of. People could fall asleep at the wheel and not be able to take over the driving when they're needed to. A lot more messing around would occur so the driver would not be focusing. Drivers need to stay focused on the road so everyone can safely arrive to their destination.

Never know when the driverless feature could have a glitch or break down. Cars break down all the time, what's any different about the cars systems? Nothing, these cars could have been manufactured incorrectly. The GPS could also stop working or hit a glitch and you could end up 20 miles away from where you want or need to be.

Imagine. You're in your driverless car, somethings coming up that you need to take over for, but you're just talking away and having a big jam session with all your friends. Your car means to alert you but the system is broken, the car keeps moving but it thinks you're driving, you hit a construction worker. Now you have a huge fine to pay plus you have to get your car fixed.

With these new driverless cars their drivers aren't going to be paying enough attention, your car glitches out, or you're to busy having a jam session with your friends. So many things could go wrong. These cars would be teaching the youth they don't need to pay attention, the car will do it for them. All in all driverless cars are not safe and should not be developed.",3
03194a0,"This face has been the talk of NASA and the talk of headlines for quite sometime. The topic has been argued many times and there are many different opinions on whether or not its a face or a natural landform. What do you think?

The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this ""face"" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face. There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.

In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face. The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face.

After all the questions blew over, Directors began putting images and shots into movies which again started raising talk. In movies or films there are special effects people that are able to enchance photos and clips. So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this.

Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. Science it to greatly advanced now and if there was any form of life on any other planets NASA would atleast have an idea of it. I don't believe this is an alien artifact, because Mars cannot support life.          ",4
031ab01,"If we had a facial action coding system in every classroom, Would the students have a higher chance of suceeding? Would they get more or less help? Would this gather more attention in class? I would think so. I mostly agree with having a facial Action Coding system in classrooms to tell how the students are feeling. I disagree with some aswell. If the teachers could tell exactly how each student is feeling in class, like bored or confused, I think that they would provide more help to those students, and there will be a higher percentage of people who pass there clases. In the passage making Mona Lisa Smile, they used the technology on the painting of Mona Lisa. I think that if they used it on the students, they would be more engaged and ready to learn.

I think that the students would find more things being taught to them in class interesting. In the passage it has an example that I think would be good for the use of this software to be in schools. ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If this were to happen, I know that I would do a lot better. I feel that many other students would do better too. When we get an ad that we like, and similar ads pop up, usually they are watched. If we were in class and we felt happy, or not happy with what we are learning, The teaching style or lesson might change to something that will keep more students engaged. But I feel like their are other things that aren't so good about the software.

If the softwared was installed in every class and you walked in feeling very upset for something that maybe happened outside of class or school, you will most likely feel that way the whole time during that class. The machine might pick that up as if you are not being interested in the topic. You wouldn't get anywhere. Now if you tell the teacher that you aren't happy for whatever reason, thats a different story. But, if you're shy and you don't tell people how you feel especially if something happened to make you feel sad, angry, etc... I don't think the machine would help to much in terms of education. But if you are more engaged in learning because of the software, I think their will be a way higher chance for more people to graduate.

If you are engaged, interested, or into whatever you're learning, You will most likely be paying attention and taking in the information. If you were in class, and the software picks up that you understand whats being taught, more people would focus in that class. If this happens, more people would pass tests, exams, and graduate. After you graduate, you will have learned all the education that you needed to learn to go to college. Sence more people have the education, more people would go to college.

If we had the facial action coding system software in classrooms I think that more people would have a higher chance of succeeding, getting help, paying attention, passing tests and exams. I also think that more people will go to college. I think that more people would pay attention, be interested in what they're learning, and I think it would be easier to more students. If the software were to mess up, I think that the teachers would have more problems to deal with like getting it fixed, or just simply teach without it. If their are no problems with it, I think that this would be a very helpful tool for teachers and students.",4
031bbb0,"Do you think this ""face"" was created by aliens? I think not because this ""face"" was not created by aliens but created by a natural landform. Landforms happen all the time, just because it happend on another planet doesn't mean aliens did it.

In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it ""huge rock formation"" . Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says ""formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Its just an allusion not even a face really.

Also, the aticle says ""there was no alien monument arter all."" if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA

thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it?

In conclusion, the ""face"" was not created by an aliens or aliens, but was just created by a landform.    ",3

03205e9,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It is the second planet from the Sun. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about the dangers of exploring Venus. The author describes the temperature of Venus, the danger of its light, and the overall danger. Besides explains what Venus, a planet and not a star, looks like, the author also states that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""Twin"". Both planets are close in size and density. One difference is that Venus is over 200 times hotter in temperature than Earth is. The average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees in Fahrenheit. That is hotter than Earth will ever be. In In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author also states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury in closer to the sun."" In that example from the story, the author is trying to explain that Venus is so hot that it would melt anything in less then a minute.

Besides being so hot, Venus is also very bright. Venus's light is brighter than our eyes could ever see. It is so bright on Venus that not even researches can take a photo or a video of the planet. This must mean that research have to keep their distance. If they get close, they will have the risk of becoming blind or dying from the hot temperature. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" The author also states, ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" The auther is trying to explain that since researchers have to keep their distance, they can't take a sample with them to Earth. Samples from Venus would help them gain knowledge of Venus.

Venus has many dangers and risks of exploring the planet. Researches can't go to the planet because it is so hot and the light is very bright. Their machines keep melting from the hot temperature. The author in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains the dangers but the author also states, ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" ",4

Because of the amounts of pollution there was Paris inforced a partial driving ban in attempt to clear the air of the global city, there was a 22 fine($31). In Paris, close to 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 cars were impounded for over reacting to the fine.

I think more countries should participate in this event, just because you are limiting yourself to how much you use your car and it seems like it would be alot of fun and is honestly such a great opportunity for you and everyone around you trying to make a diffrence.

""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses"". This is actually very surprising knowing that America is and has been one of the world's prime car cultures. ""They are not interested"", Said a mom of two children that are 19 and 21. She said, ""even though they both live in places where one could come in handy....but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take a public transportation or car-pool with friends."" To me I think these adults are making a statment. That you do not always have to have a car, and you most definatly do not have to have a licence to get you places. These teenagers are saving their money not having to worry about gas prices and car payments. Instead they are not wasting their money by walking and car-pooling to their jobs. It might take some time walking but you still get there.

In conclucion, I feel like getting to places with cars is fast, and I know most people agree with me...but why not just once in a couple of days just drop your keys and ride your bike or walk to work. Limit how much you use your car. I promise you you will see a difference in your life.             ",3
0329d02,"I am against driverless cars because I think the electrical components and computer software are more likely to fail than a human driver. The idea of a driverless or smart car was actually a really dumb idea if the smart car was really 'smart' then it could navigate its way through roadwork but people just keep getting lazier and lazier their always looking for much easier ways of doing stuff, my personal opinion is that we need to go back to making vehicles like we did in the 1970s they were simple, easy to fix, and were real nice looking vehicles. The human drivers of a driverless car can easily be distracted by all this technology the car manufacturers have put in and on these vehicles that they could be driving and end up in a fatal crash just because they was distracted by some 3-D lazer mapping or a camera on the inside of the car.

These kind of cars would change the world but people would regret it later on in the years when more and more people get killed because of them. If it ever happens I do not care what people say or do I am still going to have a completly human driven vehicle i would not buy one of those junk driverless ones. ",2
032a3bf,"""Here we go again, sirens."" ""How many accidents is that now, three in less than a week?"" Car accidents are increasing by the minute as decades pass. Drivers are losing their lives each and everyday, familes are greiving over loses, friends, siblings, relatives are being lost due to drunk drivers and young teens just now starting to drive. The air pollution is also getting worse because of vehicles that are used everyday to get from point A to point B, gas prices are rising and sometimes you cant even get to places sometimes because theres so much traffic in the street! We can prevent many of these problems by simply limiting the use of time people spend driving .

U.S. citizens should have a right in the dispute people are having over this topic. Should the U.S. limit the use of vehicles being used everyday? Yes. Millions of dollars are wasted everyday for people need gas in their vehicles to get to where they're going. Money that could be used to feed their familes or money that also can be used to buy clothes and other necessary things. There are Amercian citizens that live on the streets or in alleys that are in desperate need of clothes, food or even a home & here we are spending it on something that can be replaced by something as simple as walking or riding a bike to where you need to go.

Every year there are more and more car accidents being reported and the number keeps increasing. Teens that are in highschool and are just now driving on the roads are one of the top main causes on car accidents, another main cause of accidents are drunk drivers. Americans like to go to parties or gatherings or even just bonfires with friends sometimes and they drink recklessly. Then when time comes for them to leave, they get in their cars intoxicated, driving to wherever they need to go and boom! Their reactions just werent quick enough or they werent paying as much attention as they would driving sober and they crash into anything that came their way. Injuries were made, a life or maybe more than one was lost all because of a mistake that was made earlier that day.

Another reason why cars should be limited is air pollution. If cars are needed to be used on and everyday basis they should make them more ""enviornmentally friendly"". Some gases in gasoline are toxic and/or flamable. Gasoline can drip on something without you knowing and the tinest spark could ignite something so simple, that could turn into a burning fire. Your belongings could be burned to ashes or your car could even blow up into flames. Then money is needed to repair the damage or valuables that couldnt be replaced could be gone. The burning of everything could also release toxins into the air and cause sicknesses in some or could damage our ozone layer more then it already is.

Im not saying people should be banned from every using vehicles again, but it would help greatly if the usage is limited up to a certain point or instead of destroying, it could be used to benefit our enviornment; even leave it neutral.

Americans need to understand that there is more to life then sitting and letting things happen for you. Go for walks, take hikes, rollerblade, plan a bike ride through the park with the family, theres more to life than cars and vehicles. Sure its nice to go somewhere without having to walk but sometimes its good to have family outings and its also refreshing and fullfilling to feel the crisp, cold air hit your skin, walking outside the house on a cold day.

032db9e,"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro (31 U.S. dollar) fine.

Bogota, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 car-free day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twenty-five dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definately see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars. These days have proven many of these claims that support the assertion that there are multiple advantages to limited car usage.                                ",4
03314fd,"After reading this article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I believe that being able to detect and know how to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and could be useful for many. Using technology to know whether an individual is upset, happy, mad, etc. could be used as an improvement on our daily lives. According to the article, they tested this new technology on the famous Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting and defined that ""she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The outcomes from this new technology system could actually be legit and can tell us what people feel. This new sofware can also help the people that are to afriad to express their feelings or don't know how to .

Sense there are some individuals who hid their feelings and aren't that easy to read their emotions by just looking at their facial expressions, by using this system you could read and even track their face movments and even their mixed emotions also. For instance, as stated in the passage ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"".""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This new software can help those who have a ""neutral face"" and show no emotion.

Facial expressions aren't always going to reveal how an individual is actually feeling or what emotions he is going through inside. For example, in the article it indicates that the Mona Lisa is ""9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", even though in the painting she looks 100 percent happy. This software will read off your emotions no matter what face expression you are making. Many of us can use this software to figure out what others are feeling when they are to scared to tell others how they feel. For instance, if someone is feeling really upset and has a neutral face and you can't tell that they are upset, you can't help them unless you know how they are feeling.

In conculsion, I believe that This new software ""Facial Action Coding"" that helps reveal human emotions by using technology cn be valuable and useful for certain people.",3
0331f55,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future, or are they? The Article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨ allows us to believe that maybe thery´re not a thing of the future, but actually a right now present day modification to our way of living.. Now is this a good thing regarding the safety of the common people, I believe so. Does it help or economy, lets discuss and see.

First off the article points out that google has been doing thier test runs since 2009. ¨Their cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.¨ No one has been killed in these test runs, and how many have been killed in regular driving since 2009, the number is sad. Driving these cars arent as dangerous as people make them out to be. I would also like ot point out that these cars may be able to dive themselve's, but Google cars arent entirely driverless. They're unable to back out , and navigate through roadworks and accident, so they allert the driver in those situations. The car knows when its unsafe for it to be the one in control of driving so, its going to alert you to take over and get through this. Some of the ways engineers have allowed this is with vibrating seats, and flashing lights in the car. Some have even suggested getting a camera installed inside the car, that way the car knows if your paying attention while you are driving. Next these cars are not made so people can daze off, and text on their phones, or just not do anything in the car. Special sensors in the sterring wheel allow the car to know if you have your hands on the wheel. The cars are designed so that the driver must stay alert while drivig, and ready to jump in when roads require human skills. With all of these necessary precautions in store, and the history of how well Google has managed so far, it´s very safe for the right driver to be behind the wheel of one of these cars.

Its the best option we have economically wise, of changing the world, and advancing the world. Smart roads were investigated, in the 1950's general motors created a consept car that could run on a special test track embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever at the front end of a car. Again Berkley tried the same thing using magnets and alternating polarity. The smart roads worked very well, but the cost of upgrading all of our roads to fit the criteria was to much of a hit to the economy, the smartest choice was to modify cars so that they could become smart enough to be dirverless. To be safe the cars have a lot of sensors installed into them. The most important sensor having to be LIDAR on the roof of the car. This sensor shootss out a laser beam to form a constantly 3-D model of the cars surroundings. To help the economy its safer to update the cars with these, then to fully update the road systems we have now.

Driverless cars are not a thing of the future, ther're a present day modification to our way of living. They're not anymore dangerous then driving a normal car, and may even be a bit safer. Also they're the best choice econoimcally that our country can provide, to improve our way of living and advance us that much further. So why not get with the new era and drive a driverless car.                                                                                                                    ",4

Another pro about Driverless cars is that it will most likely fundementally change the world as we know it because if the manufactuers develop Driverless cars then you won't see pedestrians using the bus, train, or the regular automotive vehicle.

According to the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", there are also many con's or negative conotations concerning Driverless Cars.

033aa4b,"Venus is a planet in space, that is the second planet from the sun and the closest plant to Earth density and size wise.

Other dangerous conditions are such as the temperatures that ""average 800 degrees Fahrenheit.""

The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. It is a worthy pursuit because researchers can explore new types of rocks, gas, and etc. Because Venus is such as harsh planet, it makes everything on the planet that much rare. Despite the conditions, when things on the planet are discovered it can make a huge impact on the history of space and scientists.

The second reason why it´s a good reason to explore Venus it because of the future. If NASA finds a way to explore Venus (because of the extremely harsh weather condition) then we could possibly explore other planets in the soloar system without being worried of other weather relate obstacles.

Even though exploring Venus will take a long time, it will worth waiting. If NASA explores Venus and goes succesfully, then it could cause a scientific break through, leading science into a new world of innovation, new technology, and a more sophisicated world.

0345980,"Driverless cars are going to be amazing when they are released to the public.

They are very intelligent machines that can make better or faster decisions than humans can on the road. Even though they are just testing them now, they still haven't caused any accidents. Think about it, everyone who drives a driverless car will have the option to steer, so it's their choice whether their life is at risk.

Driverless cars haven't caused car-on-car accidents. The text states that driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. There have been a few cases where the driverless cars were involved in accidents, but that was because other people wrecked into them. They usually don't make road errors, but other people mess them up because of their bad driving habits.

Drivers still have the option to take the wheel if they feel, or if the car feels, like

something is wrong. The text states that driverless cars require some human skill so they would have to take the wheel at some point, but the rest of the driving is optional. The text also states that the driverless cars are also being programmed to warn the driver when they need to take control. The only drawback to this is that drivers will still have to be alert at all times incase the car needs their help.

It may take some time before they are fully safe. The text states that there are some situations where humans would have to take control of the car like pulling out of driveways or moving around construction zones. This implies that the cars can't deal with humans very well. They can still manage to get in accidents with pedestrians if those people aren't dong what they are supposed to like J-walking. It will take awhile before driverless cars are upgraded with more reliable sensors that can detect pedestrians and even animals too.

Driverless cars are going to be a huge innovation that changes the way everyone travels. Driverless cars are safe, fast decision makers, and help people get from place to place without driving the whole time. I wouldn't turn down a trip in something that has all of those great qualities. Driverless cars will truely be amazing when they are released.",4

They don't know if they actually seen a face they said it was winter on that side when this picture was tooken. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that. It is kind of weird to see other things like this on other planets that don't even have human life or something close to it for this to happen.

035e3c7,"Dear state senator,

As a law abiding citizen, I feel that the American public should have a say-so in the elections of the President, or any other government party leader, and to do so, should be a direct vote. While our Founding Fathers, with all due respect, chose the Electoral College to pick and choose our leaders, this is the 21st centuary. A centuary in which the government upholds too much power.

The government has been critized quite intensely over the last few years over one topic - lying. Lying to the citizens in which it - should - be serving. Although, it doesn't. The government serves itself. So why should we elect a panel of people to elect for us? After all, when we vote, we - I speak for the entire American republic here - imagine us submitting our vote to count directly for our selected representative. Not for some unknown nit-wit to chose a government agent for us. What if said nit-wit lies, miscounts, or purposely puts his own imput into the system instead of the American voting population?

Direct voting is, perhaps, inevitably more efficient. Our votes could run through a machine, much like a state test such as FCAT, anf the total vote could be directed for either candidate. The chances of a tied poll is rather extremely unlikely due to the masses of the American republic. Plus, it singles out the chance of lying in a government of liars.

Swing states wouldn't exist. Instead of singling out a particular area of the country, they'd be, more so, targeting the country as a whole, because then would every individual vote mattered. No one would be left out, and the more honest, obviously more chosen, president would win out, and almost everyone would be happy.

We live in a system at which the government lies, quite fairly, a lot. A direct vote would whip them out of that in the voting process, as the votes, singularly, would matter. Every last one of them. It would also nip the idea that only certain areas, certain states, mattered, because again, every vote would matter. Directing voting is obviously the way to go.

Signed,

Law Abiding Citizen.    ",3
035e589,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",4

It would not make sense that a face would be on Mars. I belive it is just a landform because it looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Globel Surveyor flow over Cydonia and took a picture and it was a natural landform. The pectures this time were ten times sharper then the ones from the original Viving picture. There was no alien monument after all. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, caompared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. With this images if there are any objects there you are going to see it.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are common to the ones in the American West. They remind us most of the Middle Burre in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

I know that the second picture was taken on a cloudy day and it was not all clear. The origanal picure did have a differnt shadow also. There was however, a third picture taken and that was on a clear day and it showed that it was just a lanform. The origanal picture only had 43 meters compared to the one in 2001 that had 1.56 meters.

In counclusion the face on Mars was just a moon. There were two pictures taken after the origanal picture and they both show that in is just landforms. I belive it is just a landform because it looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.     ",3
03630c7,"Have you ever heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program?

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a thing alot of people should do. We help out with alot of stuff such as animals, and problems that where hard to solve after World War 2. You could also see amazing sights. I'm going to tell you all about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

In 1945 we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Although there was 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance we crossed the alantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First,We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. Its a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice,and Italy. I got to explore the castel in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There is so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

There is so much more than helping animals and seeing amazing monuments and sights. You would also get to help people. There are lots of people out there who dont have much food or any shelter. World War 2 is the cause of this harm to people. First of all, helping people could give you a good reputation. Secondly, its nice to help people who are poor and don't have shelter or food. Lastly, I think it is a good thing to do for those people.

People fought in World War 2 and now its your turn to step up and lend a helping hand. This program is possibly the most helpfullest program in the U.S.A.                    ",3

The Electoral College is a very organized way of handling the Presidential election. It makes certain that tthere is usually a landslide victory. The locations of the states help the canidates and the Electoral Colloege states that you have to have transregional appeal.

The swing states such as Florida, are the states presidental canidates pay attention to. The votes there are the ones thats can decide the election. The lager states, due to there large population, also get more Electoral votes.

The Electoral Colloege has helped avioded run-off elections by reducing the complication of it all. The Electoral College is made up of five-hundred thirty-eight electors and all that is need to elect a president is two-hundred seventy electoral votes. The electoral College is the easier and less complicated way of electing a president.

Though whether the Electoral College is democratic, it is not true in a modern sense. It is still very practical and less complicated. The people instead would vote for slates of electors but, they still would be voting towards you canidate. The Electoral College is the method that we should keep.    ",2
036e19b,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.",2
036f820,"Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages. Even though there are many reasons, a big topic would be because of the gas getting in the air creating ""smog"" or pollution. Keeping the earth clean but banning cars can make the enviornment a better place.

To being with, limiting the use of cars can be very good for our enviornment because it would make the air less polluted. As stated in source 2 paragraph 5,""congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" thats a big percent and with that we are making the earth green. France even tried to ban cars even and odd to reduce the pollution as being talked about in paragraph 2 and 3. They were being fined if they drove, that is atleast until the air cleared up.

On the other hand, banning cars or not driving is a silly decision. It may be good for our earth and our health, but if you need to leave three hours before hand to reach your destination on time, then you need to buckle up and step on the gas. If gas so so bad for the enviornment, then why dont we ban gas cars? There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficlut for long road trips but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it.

Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages, but also a few disadvanteages. Cars can clean up the air but also make us gasp for it. Having a car should be a choice we get to make. Having events and days where ""no cars can be driven or you get a fine"" is not needed in anybodys lives. What decision would you decide, having a car, or joining in on being green?            ",3
03705ca,"To my fellow citizens all across the world I think there are a lot of advantages that come with the limited car usage. One thing is that it could save the environment from the polution of gas. Also it could save people a whole lot of money if they didn't have a car. Lastly and final statement why limited car usage is advantage is that they use the money from the car to buy homes.

For starters, their are a lot of things that come with buying a car but a lot of people dont no is that every time they start up there car their actually hurting the evironment because of the gas. Here is an example from source 2.""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". After reading that it seems to me that the pollution of the gas is becoming to be a problem all around the world and thats why we need to put a stop to it by just banning it for country to country and then eventually become a car free world. Another example I found from source 2. ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". I read that and i was like wow! I wonder why that might be well if they banned the car usage they might bring do there pollution or congestion in the city. Thats why the pollution from the gas is so bad it could actually harm or maybe possibly kill them if they breathe in that pollution on a consistant basis.

Secondly, people make pretty big sacrifices in life but one I found most interesting was that Germany residents were selling there cars to buy homes for them to live in. This strikes my eye in very many ways is that they are saving an expense they don't need and also saving the environment also. For example, in source 1 it said ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". I find that quite interesting why a family like that would just give up transportation and then I thought well they save a ton of money and also they get to move to maybe a better living environment just by limiting the car usage. People who live in Levittown, New York are good example of limited car usage because a lot of them work in the city and a lot of times driving into the city is not a very good thing to do because of the traffic. So what do they do? They don't drive a car but only to the train station were they ride the train to and from the city saving money in gas and its easier to do it that way.

Thirdly, citizens use limited car usage to save money in life because lets all face it the world we live in is tough money is hard to come by and people have car payments they have to pay every month and sometimes they cant make that payment cause they have other bills they have to pay so what do they do. They sell they car and that gives them extra money a month to pay for bills a such forth. Another thing they save from selling there car is that they don't have to pay for gas either so your probably saving some where around 200 hundred dollars in cash or credit in one month which is good. Thats another reason why selling your car is an advantage of limited car usage.

In conclusion, their are a lot of ways where citizens of the world can use limiting there car usage as an advantage. Where it might be saving the environment or selling your vehicle to buy a home or even maybe just to save money in everyday life like some citizens do in Levittown, New York. These were some of my opinions on advantages of limiting car usage in everyday life.                ",4
0374dae,"On may 24,2001 NASA Viking was snapping pictures around mars when something weird showed up on one of the photos. when NASA seen what looked like a human face went crazy. An ever since NASA'S crazy image got out thousends and thousends of people all around america were talking about ""the face on mars"". But Mars Orbiter Camera team came to find that it was not a human face but just a simple natural landform.

Many people believed that it was an alien artifact. Even few sciantists believed this too. But on April 5, 1998, Mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the frist time .Mas Orbiter team took a picture ten times sharper then viking photo. When the picture was taken by Mars camera team showed upon a JPL web site. Showing that the image was a natural landform, that there was no alien atifact. People still don't believe that it's just a natural landform, but this picture was taken by a digital image 3 times bigger then pixel size. so if any other objects such as airplanes, egyptial shaped pyramids, or small shacks you would most definetly see them. The landform that is actually shown on mars was a commom landform around American West.

In conclusion you can see that this image was studied very hard on to find out was it actually was, wich is a natural landform found in the American West. An if you still don't believe just think about it. The image taken that reaveled it to be a natural landform had each pixel in the 2001 spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 Viking image.",3
037545d,"The world is filled different types of technology. Apple, a major technology industry, has invented multiple types of phones, computers, watches, and televisons. Computers have evolved within the last five years and the have made a whole new world. The use of technology to read students' emotional expression is valuable because it is able to detect if a student is confused and it can track emotional-recognition.

While in school, most students do not like raising their hand or asking any questions if they are lost during a lesson because they may feel embarrassed or scared. For example in paragraph six, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" He aslo predicts, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Furtherore, Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" With the classroom computer, students may feel more comfortable and more confident in themselves because they would have the ability to learn one-on-one with an instructor to get the help they need without feeling embarrassed. In addition, the computer with be able to track emotional-recognition.

Computers that have the ability to track emotions would benefit everyone. In paragraph five it states, ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vini studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles preciesly enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" Furthermore, in paragraph six it states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad with be different."" Emotional-recognition could improve how people are feeling and help them get through the day.

In contrast, a computer that can detect emotion could not work well with some people. In paragraph six it states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad."" Also, in paragraph two it states, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" People might not like the idea of their computer knowing how they are feeling because if the computer gives them false feedback, they might not agree with the new software. In addition, people might pay money for a software that does not give them the correct emotion or the software might not work in general.

The use of technology has definetly taken over the world. With the new computer software, it is able to read how each student is feelings and how it can track the emotions of everyday people. Applying emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise could change the face of technology. ",4
0376bcb,"Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.

The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.

Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.

It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.

This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars. ",3
037ac1f,"Driverless cars

The point that the article is making is that should we have cars that can drive themselfes, in my opinoin i would say no because it would cause so much disstortion and everthing would be in a heave of trouble. What we would be doing is we would be taking away jobs for people that live off of driving people places, or we would be spending so much money trying to make these cars, and also what would happen when the went out of control and no one could stop them then what would we do.

The idea of people losing jobs dosent sound right for me because i know how frustrating it is to lose many jobs and it isn´t easy. And something else what would stop those people who are mad and ticked at the idea that they just lost their jobs to a bunch of robots, that wont go so well because they will probably start rioting in the streets and that will just cause more of a problem´s for everone.

And also you would have to conceder on how much money they would have to spend to keep making those types of cars, it will probably cost millions of dollars for just one state. So they would be spending more money on making the cars than they would be getting so it seems that it would be a waste of time on what this idea has in store.

What other problems would happen if something went wrong with these cars like to say if someone missed up with the programming it could cause a lot of problems across the united states because so many car crashes would be happening, and that would bring so much panic through out the nation. so that is another reason why not to.

So what is the article stating is if we should have cars that control themselfs. there is to many if´s for me to say that we should like i can see that there are good parts to this like to say that we wouldn´t spend so much many on gas and it would be safer for the most part. But my answer is still no because we cant alwas y just think that since it is technology we are safe will that not alwas the case and we have to learn that. So no we shouldn´t have cars that drive themselves.",3

Two doctors think they have the power to do so, Proffesor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsredam and Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

I believe that the new advancment would be a wonderful idea. I believe that seeing somebody's when they are trying to hide them is gonna bring new thrills to life. Actually knowing someone's emotions could be beneficial for thing such as suicide maybe if we knew what somebody's emotions were we would be able to help somebody to make them feel happy. In the passage article for has a quote saying ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I believe this is a good quote because it ties in with me saying that emotions could help people but having facial emotions would benefit as well because then we would not only physically see someone's emotion but we would be able to feel the happiness, pain,anger or etc.

So overall I think Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman could possibly have a amazing overall invention there are lots of positives for this invention. Such as having less suicides, or maybe if seeing someone happy could make someone else happy and could start a emotion train.

Driverless cars is a brilliant, genius idea. Having a driverless car helps better our environment, safety, and could even save you some extra money.

Pollution and global warming is a big problem. Our Earth is dying. With over population in many countries having cars that run on gas impacts our enviroment. All the fuel tha that is used is killing Earth day by day. Now, think about this. Having a car that runs on only half the fuel you would typically use? Sounds good right? Using only half the fuel we would typically use would make a tremendous differnece in our environment in a matter of a year.

Having a vehicle is a privlage. It can also be very dangerous. In the news we always here about that one person or that group of teenagers getting into a car with a driver under the influence. Then we know what happens next. When you are under the influence you do not know you are,therfore, you think you are fine to do anything especially driving. Having a driverless car may actually saves lives. If one is out drinking or doing things they should not be and decide they have to drive, that car might just save them from the unexpected.

Lastly, lets talk money. We all want to save money and buy more toys. Maybe you even want to go on a vacation to some nice beach where it is warm. How are you going to do that when you get a nice $1000 dollar spending ticket in a construction zone on I-65? Driverless vehicles maintain speed limit and know driving regulations. You may want to be going faster but your car is going to save you from getting that ticket.

Better environment, protection of human safety, and money saving is something all like to hear. This new driverless car is all that within one vehicle. Purchasing a car can be difficult. You want the best for you money. Having a car that helps the enviornment, protects you, and saves you money is the car you should be interested in. ",4
039e817,"Dear state senator,

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

The real question is, do you want your teacher to know if your happy, sad, mad, fustrated, confused, or board?

To some, the answer is simply yes, the ones who want others to know what ther are feeling are mostlikly a socil-type person.

On the other hand, its a simple no, if you know somone is gauging your emotions, say you didn't want anyone to know your mad, angery, or sad, would you be afraed to make any exprestion at all, or even go to class.

Nowadays, being watched is a normal acurance, but not to the personal level as to your emotions or thoughts.

Many may ask, what good is it to know about how one is feeling, the answer is unclear.

In paragraph six, the artical tells how helpfull FACS could be to the classroom, but if students should learn anything about real life, its crucial for them to understand, you can't please everyone, as much as you try, you won't.

If you have walked into a elementery school in just the past year, you will notice some very different souroundings.

Some elementery schools have laptops for every student, which makes it easyer than ever for a teacher to make and publish an assinment.

As I personly wittnesed my siblings having homework over the weekend, and Fridays, both of which, I never had in elementer school.

Not to mention, who will pay for such a system, our tax dollors?",2
03ae0c4,"The Electoral college is something that has been around for hundreds of years, and has helped us decide what to do. It is a fair method of electing the president, but it is not what we need anymore. Times have changed since that was established, so it is time we use a good old-fashioned way of voting, and use election by popular vote.

Back in the seventeenth century, when the Electoral College was created to find a balance between citizen voting and majority vote. How it works, is we select the electors representing our state's votes, they meet and vote, and then congress counts their votes. Also, all states, except Maine and Nebraska have something called the ""winner-take-all"" syatem, and that is a ""system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.""(s1,p7) But now, the citizens in your state who qualify as a voter cast their votes. Instead of that being what our state's choice is, we choose the electors of our candidate, or person we voted for, and then the candidate with the majority votes wins, getting atleast 270 out of 538 electoral votes. This seems very unfair, and in one specific case, it is. In the 2000 presidential election, between Al Gore and George Bush, Al Gore got more popular votes than George Bush; he should have won. But Bush had more electoral votes, and that was where is mattered. So, Bush won that. If Gore won popularity wise, he should have won, hense creating happier citizens, since he won the majority of their votes.

Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, ""may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" This is very important, as we all want a good leader who will support our home state. If, for example, the Electoral College voted on a Democrat, and he won, Florida may not have much hope. Florida is a Republic state, as is most of the southern states; yes, Mr. President would be obligated to help all 50 states when necessary, but the bigger benefits would go towards the Democratic states, and probably his home state. Therefore, voters may not even bother casting in a ballot if the candidate of their choice does not have much hope, or if they think either potential leader will benefit them. So if they do not have much of a choice in the matter, they lose interest and shrug it off, as opposed to if it were popular vote, and every single vote was accounted for. Fortunately, though, this does not happen often; one meesly vote does not do much to turn the tables.

The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation.    ",3

So many students using computers for school aren't getting the full potential out of their computers. They stay confused and move on hoping they don't fall behind evryone else.

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been  discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.    ",2
03c75d3,"Technology has evolved in amazing, big, and even complex ways. It's 2018, and there are robots that can now engage in combat, imitate humans, and open doors. It's no surprise that now there are computors that can read your emotions. Will it be benefical? I, in fact, do think this new software, the Facial Action Coding System, will be benefical, especially in classrooms. This new technology can help keep students interested in learning, awake in class, and even help teachers with teaching.

The Facial Action Coding System can indeed help keep students interested in learning. Why? First off, it's new technology. Who wouldn't be excited to get to use and experience something like this? From personal experience, I know that when I first started using computers and Ipads in middle school, it made me more excited to do work and come to class. This software can also keep students interested in learning because if the system notices the student becoming bored, it could modify the lesson, as stated in the article. When modifying the lesson, it could maybe become more animated or louder for the student's attention to be grabbed, thus spiking his or her interest.

This new software could help keep students awake in class because, as stated in the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article, if the system notices that the student is falling alsleep, it could change the lesson, make it simpler, or make it more interesting to grab the student's attention. This effect can be similar to a human instructors, which can enhance the student's mood and energy level. Usually, humans lose interest and become tired when bored or when something is repetitive, and as stated above in my first point, making the lesson more animated or louder could prevent the student from losing interest, which could lead to dozing off.

And for my last point, putting this technology in classrooms for students, could actually benefit the student and the teacher at the same time. If the program notices that the student is becoming bored or losing interest, this could be a sign to the teacher to adopt a new teaching style or change up the presentation to better engage the student. Using this as an advantage could help strengthen the relationships between the students and the teachers to ensure a better, more effective, and easier learning environment for the students and an easier, more effective teaching environment for the instructors.

The addition of the Facial Action Coding System to classrooms today will absolutely benefit not only teachers, but also students. It'll first off, keep students awake to even learn the lesson, then proceed to keep the students interested in the lesson being taught, and overall will help teachers know how to best connect with his or her students and provide the best and most effective way of teaching to them. And not only do the benefits stop here, but they go on and on, adding paint to the big picture. This software can be used in even preschools and colleges. Ensuring that the students are being taught in the best way will heighten their academic skills and will provide a promising future full of success. Just from starting with the projection of a smile.

03ce0a7,"Imagine a world with driveless cars. While that world is coming to picture, be sure to also imagine all the things that could possibly go wrong. Imagine an increase in car accidenets because a malfunction occured in one of the cars. All the money and time that is being invested in this one specific project. Teenagers no longer getting excited about being able to get their license. Seems like a not so great world to live in.

Manufactors may promise people that their smart cars are safe and reliable, nothing will go wrong. But what they dont tell people is that they messed up on a couple thounsand cars, no biggie. The smart cars are no longer alerting the driver for when they need to take over. The spinning sensor just breaks down, with no warning whatsoever. That is one of the most important parts of the whole system. Everything could go wrong. Promises are broken by family; companies can easily break promises too.

So much money and time could be put into better and more useful things. This all started back in the 1950s with General Motors. Google has had working driveless cars since 2009. All of that time and money should have been invested into something that tis world needs. The United States of America has been in debt for a long time, but instead of paying off some debt we build driveless cars.

Teenagers are excited about finally being old enough to get thier permit, their first car. That is what the majority of us look foward too. We finally feel like an adult and have some freedom. With driveless cars, how would this all work out? In the pasage it says, ""... no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.."" That is no fun. What will we have to look foward to now? No one will need cars.

I am against driveless cars. They may be what we dream of but that doesnt mean they are best for us. Malfuctions could occur which causes a rise in accidents. Possibly even death. Money and time is wasted on this project and it is not what the world needs. The world does not need driveless cars. Teenagers need to experience freedom early, by getting their license and having their own car. If we will no linger have any point for cars in the future, how will teenagers expeince the early life of adulthood? ",4
03d074f,"Mr. Senator,

I think that the Electoral College is a decent way to vote for president. But is it really the best way? Though the Electoral College elects presidents in a way favored by many, it doesn't allow for people to directly vote for the president. Because of that, the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to election by popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College can make things unfair. As stated in the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College"", ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Source 2). That statement basically says that when a voter goes to vote, they aren't voting for the president, but for someone to go and vote for them. Also, who exactly are the people we go and let vote for the person leading our country? According to the article, ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office"" (Source 2). The people who go and vote can't control who these electors vote for. That's just another way that the Electoral College can be unfair to the voters.

Along with being unfair to the voters, the Electoral College can also be unfair to other people as well, for example, the canidates actually running for president. In an article that is for the Electoral College, it states that, ""...the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (Source 3). Does this mean that the Electoral College may have been a good system a while ago, and maybe not as good this day in age? Yes, it does. Also, in the article, it states, ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" (Source 3). That being said, there is always a chance that the result of an election will not be what the country as a whole wants, but what the electors want.

To conclude, the Electoral College is a very interesting proccess that everyone should know about. But I believe that the Electoral College should be a process that stays in textbooks to be learned about, not to actually be used. The Electoral College should be gone and be changed to election of popular vote. After all, the Preamble to the Constitution says, ""We the people"", not ""We the electors"".

03d8fe8,"Imagen being in a regular classroom. Imagen yourself not understing the topic. Imagen not being able to tell the teacher you don't get it because you're afraid to be made fun of. This is what the Facial Action Coding System prevents student from experiencingwhen taught a new topic. This helps student by having the system already knowing they don't understand to topic they had just learned. Although Facial Action Coding System watches your face is wierd, it'll help out teachers and students because it'll help our classroom be more understanding, helpful, and communicate better.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be more understanding.

In the article, it states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelling simply by the look on her face (paragraph 5)."" It also states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears in you screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnet (paragraph 6)."" These quotes show that classrooms can be more understanding with this system. Because if you frown, the teacher will be notified and will ask if you understand yet or need help. And this system will help teachers to more ""calculated"" of what their class needs more work on. And understand the topic they have learned.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be helpful. In the article it states,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor (paragraph 6) ."" This means that this system can be helpful by providing information to the teacher. And so the teacher can have an effective teaching plan to help out the class in learning the topic better. So they don't get lost and confused on the topic.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms communicate better. In the article it said,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. ""Most humans communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to undersatnd that, too(paragraph 6)."" This all means that this sysytem will help us communicate better. And because most of human communication happens nonverbally. It won't be too diffcult to do. This system will help the students and the teacher to communicate with each other effectivly without saying a word.

In concluion, better communication, more helpful, and more understanding are some of the pros of having the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom. Although having the Facial Action Coding System watch your face is pretty weird. Other than that, it's pretty cool that it can help the student(s) and the teacher. The students get a chance to work together to help the teacher understand them better. This system helps them communicate better overall. And helps the teacher to create a better and effective teaching plan overall, too. This Facial Action Coding System helps the student and the teacher to understand, comunicate and help each other.

03da458,"I feel like driverless cars are a great idea. It's truly great from how i see it a sign of the future. People should really see this on a positive note, you get so much from a driverless car. Driverless car is the future of things it is for the better of mankind. Hopefully people see it the way i see it.

You get so much from a driverless car don't know why some states would outlaw the use of driverless cars I could see why they would worry, for the pedestrians, drivers, and passengers. cause after all safety is the most important but if they would actually overlook the bad consiquences and see driverless car use isn't bad. After all the way the driverless cars are being made now are way more safer with all new features. All these car companies making driverless cars I'm pretty sure they're making it way safer. The law should be taking out of these states and see how safe driverless cars are.

The driverless car has all these great features that I do not understand why some would be against it. For example, BMW announced the development of "" Traffic Jam Assistant"". Which means that the car can handle driving funtions at speed up to 25 mph, but the touch sensors it has make sure the driver has their hands on the wheel. It's come pretty far to where the car can steer, accelerate and brake themselves. Also GM

has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is about to back into an object. Also thoughts of some manufacturers consider using camers to make sure the driver is focused on the road.

The future is near with how it's come from driving to driverless cars. all the technology going into this car and off like the specially designed roads for specially designed cars. also car manufacturers like Audi, Mercedes Benz, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. That is coming soon we're in the year 2016 and it's just 4 more years away the future is calling. Driverless cars are just the beginning of the future nothing better than that.

In conclusion I am all for driverless cars like I've said it's a great Idea. With all the technology in the self driven car and the beauty in it. Sure some states and people are against it with worrying about safety and thats understandable but soon they'll see all the good a self driven car can be and some states will go down on that law. Also like i said it is the future for driving and we'll need to adapt we always have and i know we''ll adapt to driverless cars. I approve driverless cars.",4
03dc26a,"Is the Facial Action Coding System really worth it to put it in schools and other places. This new idea can tell how you're feeling by just the scan of your face. There is alway error in such things known as technology. The idea of a scanning machine can tell how I feel seems a little different.

I don't believe this type of machines should be in our schools. I feel like this could cause confusion anf distrut form kids who don't like it. Sometimes kids like to keep to themselves and don't want some tecaher walking around taking pictures. How do we know if this is truly right. lets say that some kids get areading that they're happy or super sad when really they don't feel like that at all. There's to much error to have happen that it just doesn't seem worth it. If this has actually never been trieed on a living human who says it works. How do we know that Mona Lisa really felt like that. She can't tell us that she's dead.

With schools we need to worry on more important stuff. at times we seem to wonder why we lose out on so much money this just doesn't seem like a good investemnt. There is to much that can go wrong and not enough that can go right. Maybe later on if this was perfected but for now I don't support this. Maybe one day this will work out I just don't see it anytime soon becoming the next big thing.                                         ",2
03e687e,"Are you excited to get that new car you've been saving all your hard works money for? Cant wait to drive whenever you want and not have a care about where you go? Maybe us as a society has the wrong idea of cars and what they do for us. Cars have been givin this impression that they are what us young adults want and need to become an adult or even for some people ''cool'' but we've got the wrong idea.

Americans use cars almost everyday, numerous times a day, spening loads of money on gas and filling up our ozone with pollution but for most lifes outisde the United States they prefer to walk, bike ride, run anything except a car. Vaubran ,Germany have given up their cars. 70% of Vaubrans families do not own cars and about 57% sold a car to move there. Giving that most subrub lifes are over populated there would be no room for all those cars, but if you're that person that needs a car you must buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. ''When I had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way'' said by Heridrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, as she walks the busy path ways of Vauban streets. MOst countries are like Vauban, over populated with little to no car usage. Most people travel by foot, bus or bike and have been proven to not only heelp save thier environment but save lifes but you still have some countries that work like America. Bogota, Colombia does us cars very frequent but has a ''car free'' day which a large amount of Colombias population (7 million) participates in. '' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode with his wife on a two seat bicycle as it poured. '' The rain didnt stop people from participating'', ''We enjoy this, its better for us as a society''. Many other countries saw this remarkable change that they were trying to accomplish and really were motivated to cut cars out and start walking, biking..

Paris, France typically has more smog than other European capitals. The cause for this smog is to be said it comes from the Diesel fuel since Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles droven in France. The smog was so serious and dangerous that it traveled to Beijing China, which they did not need since they are the most populate city in the world.  France and lots of other countries have smog/ pollution problems caused by cars. France has plug-in cars, hybrids, more cars carrying three or more passangers, and public transport free of charge Friday threw Monday clogging up our o-zone. Many people across the globe have notice this big error its causing and try to make a stop to it. Lots of citizens try to cut back on their driving or try to find closer areas to work or for school to make it easier them to walk, bike ride to. For instance, the sons of Michael Sivak who are in their 20's travel by foot since driving was ''not a big concern for them.'' ''They organize their summer jobs and social lifes around where they can walk, take public transport or car pool with friends''. Even young adults are seeing the greatness in doing something good for them and thier environment.

Driving is a big part of our world today, but we have some people and even countries who have to or choose to do it by foot. Its proven to help the mind  and also proven to help with our environment and our safety life. Pollution fills the air but so does the people, making the world a better place to live and causing less stress to the citizens that do so.            ",3

The residents of the community have given up their cars.  Street parkings and driveways are forbidden in the new district near the French and swiss borders. the streets are completely empty except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community. In addition, 70% of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. A growing trend going around they say they want to seperate them from auto use, a saying called ""smart planning"". the efforts that they put in that some people build their own houses to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions from tailpipes. In Europe they are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United states.

In conclusion, there have been effortsain the past two decades to make the cities more dense, and better for walking. Home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, this may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. above all this, stores are placed on about a walk away, on a main street rather then along some distant highway. According to them how much you drive is as important as weather you have a hybrid. Suburbs will spread out the homes were thwe dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. in the developing world where they will increase number of private cars ownd by the middle class. In the United states, the enviromental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legistlators are starting to act cautiously. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role.

Above all of this paris bans driving due to smog. days after near record pollution they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or get charged with a 31$ fine. the same thing would apply tot he odd numbers the following day. about almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to the reuters, and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. it was down by 605 in the capital of France, after a five days of horrible smog, it rivaled that Beijing, china, which was known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cold air and warm days would cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Deisels make up to 67% of vehicles in france, campared to 53.3% rest of Western Europe, according to reuters. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. paris had 147 per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found.

Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while eceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital of 7 million. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violaters faced 25$ fines. It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution they said.

03ee9ea,"In this article it talked a lot about how maybe schools could use computers to sensor a student's emotion of either getting bored or losing interest and to be able for the computer to change the lesson slightly to get the students attention, But do you think this would really work? In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. Why? Because some students may have diformaties in their muscles in their face, facial piercings that could afftect they way the computer reads your emotion, or even just simply you face might be showing one expression but you may feel another way.

Not everyone in the world is same so it's really hard to make something like this that would benefit everyone. You also have to think about the cost of these computers, just think normal computers are already expensive, but ones that can read your emotion you can imagaine that those prices would be unbelievable.

As well as every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students. So overall I believe that this product wouldn't be very successful due to a lot of the roadblocks in the way, especially with money involvment. ",2

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"". If the computer could understand when the student is having a problem and can effectively fix that issue, then this could be the best way to teach. The use of reading students emotional expressions is valuable, because they can be taught better.

""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D comuter model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles...

03f958f,"""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" Cars that can drive independently are a huge advancement in technology, travel, saftey, and history. Driverless cars, which they are called, are a positive and wonderful thing to have. This essay will provide why driverless cars should be developed.

Although there has been a large leap in vehicle technology, the cars are not yet completely driverless. With more and more research and test being done there will one day be a completely driverless car.

When the vechicle was first invented it took many trial and errors but it was never given up on. The driverless car is in the stage of developement and should not be given up on. People do not forget the first model vechicle because it changed history and made things easier and more convient. The same thing can happen with the driverless car.

""Their (Google) cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.""

Crashes can be caused by anything, but having vehicles that drive the exact same could potentially reduce the risk of accidents. In the driverless cars, drivers are still needed to stay alert at the wheel because the car cannot handle obstacles such as: passing constrcution or passing accidents. They need to continue to test and develope the driverless car so one day it can over come these obstacles.

With all cars there are dangers. If the driver of the driverless car is to cause an accident then the driver is held responsible. This car cannot promise hundred percent safety, and neither can any other vehicle. That does not let automakers stop them from continuing their work. The more reseach and developement they do the more problems they can resolve. Car manufactures have plans to make cars compelety capable of driving themselves.

The driverless car may take a few years to be made perfect, but automakers are not willing to give up. A driverless car can be good for technology advances, safety, travel, and a mark in history. Driverless cars need to be backed and have support in order to be completely succsessful. And the more developement and reseach done the closer automakers become to creating a change in history, a driverless car.",3
03fb253,"Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating ""The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy"" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall. Even though its still pretty dangerous and pretty hard work for someone it can still be enjoyable Im not going to say the same stuff I already said earlier so Im just going to say that depending on how it goes and how you act about it it will be enjoyable just wait and see.",2
03ff4c1,"First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.

Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.

Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.

Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?

In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.               ",3
03ffbb2,"Imagine a town where the streets are empty of cars and stores and shops are just a walk down main street.  Well that town exists, its called Vauban, Germany a town on the border of the swiss and france.  People who live there gave up their cars and now live a different type of life.  Most people who have done this are happy they can just walk to places.  Back in the 50's this would be the town to live in.  It still has a strong appeal to people.  The way it is run makes it one of the most intresting town in europe.

This plan worked for them why cant we do this in Bradenton?  Now this type of town would benifet anyone.  People would save money.  The town or city would make double or even more of what they are making in public transportation.  The enviornmet would get healthy and make any town less polluted and help in the fight of greenhouse gases.

We all know how expensive gas can be and how it goes up and down.  With cars being took out the only thing we'd need gas for is buses that would transport us.  Our wallets will thank us and so will the planet.

Speaking of the planet greenhouse gases are the talk of the town and will not stop unless we do spmething.  We can help by doing this plan.  We can never undo what we have done to the ozone layer.  However we can certainly not make it worse by doing this.  In fact we could cut down pollution and make bradenton the city it once was.

04030c7,"Although it does seem like looking back to the past is the right thing, sometimes changing the past can have good effects for the future. The founding fathers that established the United States Constitution also established the Electoral College. Even though it has been used for many years it is the not most accurate form of voting. The popular vote is much more accurate in which the citizens of the United States vote for who they want.

One of the many problems with the Electoral College system is that the citizens of that state don't vote for president. Instead they vote for electors which then vote for president. They vote for the electors that they think are trustworthy and are going to vote for the candadite they want to win. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors an end of voting for the wrong candidate. In addition there can be a tie in the Electoral College and in that case the election would be thown to the House of Reprsentatives where state delegations vote on the president.

Every state receives an amount of point decided by the population of that state. ""It is unfair for voters because of the winner takes all system."" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) If a state is won by only 3 votes the candidate that wins the state, takes all the points for that state. Therefore it is possible to win the Popular vote and lose the Electoral Vote. In that case the winner of the electoral vote would be pronounced president of the United States of America.

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Each state has a favorable amount of democrats or republicans, therefore, candidates don't go to states or run ads in states they know the cannot win due to the state being to far into the enemy party. States that change from a democrat to a republican state and vice versa are called ""swing"" states. Those are states that the candidates running for president will want to visit and run ads in.

Electoral College has followed us since the Constitution was established, but it is time that we leave it behind and look to a new voting system. We need to abolish Electoral College because it is an unreliable way for to run the campaign for becoming the president of the United States of America.    ",3
040ba87,"I argue in changing the electoral college , popular vote would be a chance for normal americans to get there voice heard in the government. A big problem is how the voters votes go straight to the electoral college and wouldnt make a change at all also how theres a bigger chance of a tie happening in the electoral college then by popular vote

One reason why the electoral college should go is because the voters votes arent really being heard. For example in paragraph 10 it says that ' under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect for the president "" , thats techinally saying that the electors are the ones who are really voting our voice means nothing we could have wanted another president to have won but if the electoral college gets more votes then us then so be it , thats our new president! We dont even know who the electors really are they could have been picked by anyone like how it says in paragraph 10 they could have been picked by the presidential candidates themselves who knows. They say we control who the electors vote for but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane.

A second reason is how theres a bigger chance of electoral college tie happening then a popular vote one like how it says in paragraph 12 "" in 1916 , a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and a 3,3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"". If the electoral college has a tie then theres even a bigger chance of the people voice not being heard at all. Once a tie happens the election goes to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president as said in paragraph 12 , a single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have no say compared to the 55 representatives from California that makes Wyoming have no voice in the election compared to Califorina. The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

Finally thats all i have to say regarding how the election should be changed to having the popular vote determine the president , we want our voice to be heard! Sometimes the electoral college doesnt pick the president that we wanted and if there was a tie to happen in the electoral college which is at high risk some of the states voices wouldnt get heard at all , thats why we should switch over to popular vote maybe more people would actually get up and go vote because they would know their vote actually means something. Like it says in paragraph 14 "" Abolish the electoral college! "".    ",4
040bb8a,"I feel as though driverless cars are very contoversial. The are some pros and cons to having a computer control a car. With that being said I feel as though driverless cars are not something that should happen, at least not now. There are far too many complications that come with not having to drive.

There is a fine line between needing something and deserately wanting it, and I feel as though cars that don't need drivers are something that people just want. I feel as though the amount of people that need driverless cars pales in comparison to what else could be done with the money that is spent on driverless cars. In the passage, it clearly stated that an idea for driverless cars is ridiculously expensive. Granted the idea was from the 1950s, but there is no doubt that to total cost of driverless cars would still be outrageous. Driverless cars just seem unneccesary because the money spent on driverless cars could go towards something better, like starving children or homeless people.

Another flaw of having driverless cars are the danger of it. Technology is no where near perfect and one small mistake in the car could cause a ginormous car accident. What if a child darts out infront of a car, and there is no driver to stop it? What if there is an accident and the driverless car doesn't detect it? There are too many possibilities for something that isn't a neccessity.

So far driverless cars aren't even driverless. People still need to sit in the front seat and they still need to be alert at all times. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating throigh work zones and around accidents."" Also there isn't a set date for when the driverless cars will get done. Car companies plan on releasing some driverless cars in 2020, but there are compliations that could arise and slow down the process.

Driverless cars seem cool and they could make things easier for the human population. However cars that don't need drivers are something that the world doesn't need right now. There are too many ""what-ifs"" that come with driverless cars. Besides there are more useful things that people could be putting their money, focus, and time on. Building shelters for people in need, donating food and water to sountries that have a lack of, and attempting to make the world a safer place for people are thing that people should be focusing on. Not just a new car that seems cool.",4
04128c7,"Driving cars that could drive you anywhere as in a taxi or your own car are finally coming to our furture and comig fast. There are many people out there who disagree on the idea Google has came out with. There are many different reson why you should and should buy this car they can be seen in positives and negatives. My reason when it comes to buying a driveless car is that you should or try to get a driveless car, but on the other had there are some bad reason why you shouldnt.

First few positive reasons I think you should buy this car is because its a proven fact that it can lower the risk of texting a driving. Since the 2000s the rate of texting and rving drivng has went up a massive of numbers. And plus they made a few models of the google car back in 2000 for a special track and it proved that its safe and could lower the stakes of a accident. They took one to the street and drove it 1 million miles and havent even crashed yet. But when it comes to parking and coming in a drive way its up to the driver to do that.

Then when it comes down to the gas its very conservant. For an example when the driver is sleepy or had a long day at work they can take a little nap whe its in driveless mode. If there are any roadblocks or construction problems the car will alert the driver that it is time to take action and drive. And if there is any misconveince the car will knock down the speed to about 25 mph. This furture car can turn, accelerate and even brake. Is this what we been waiting for all of our lifes?

Finaly when it comes down to buying this car do it!! Who would ever imagine a car driving itself when ever the driver needs it to. Like a friendly robot that is always there for you when you need them. In this few positives and barely any negatives my addvice is add the new car to your collection or garage. ",3
041804e,"Are you confused, angry, or sad? What if a computer could help you understand more to take away your confusion. Technology has been advancing little by little and we are at the point in time where a computer is now able to read your face and emotions. Two professers have been working hard to create a new software that can recognize emotions. They are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The use of technology in the classroom is huge. Most students are now learning lessons planned by their techers' via laptops and etc. Sometimes students struggle to comprehend their teahcer's lessons and tend to be confused because of the way they are taught. Every student learns a different way and sometimes the teacher runs out of options to help the student understand. Now, computers have a different mind. They are more ""intelligent"" than humans. They can program different things for different people. This new software could be very valubale in a classroom because it can help explain things in ways that a teacher can't and will be able to adjust to the students comprehension.

Math can be a very stressful and difficult subject to comprehend. Sometimes teachers cant explain how to solve an equation easily which is how computers could help do those things. If you're reading through your teachers lesson and see his/her explanation on how to solve but you don't quite understand it, you tend to make a face of confusion. The computer may read that and see that you are having difficulty understanding the issue and may make the work easier for you to understand.

Last but not least, some student's tend to get frustrated or annoyed and decide to give up. A student giving up is not a good thing because they then don't learn what they were meant to learn. The computer may notice that a child is getting annoyed or upset and can find a different more fun and entertaining way to help the student. Just a simple change in the form of the lesson may give a student motivation to learn instead of quitting and giving up. Sometimes all a student needs is for something to be adjusted to their understanding and level.

This software created by two professers could be very valuable in a classroom. There are many benefits it could bring but there are some problems it could cause as well. Overall, this software will have a positive effect to help a child know they can be helped to understand what they dont. It could produce a new learning enviornment to the students comprehension and many test grades and etc could improve. ",4
042167f,"In Europe, a new trend has started. Many towns have banned the ownership of cars. One town that this happened in is Vauban, Germany. In this town, citizens are living lives without a lot of stress. They enjoy riding tandem bikes with their wives and walking alone. In Paris, the act has been picked up. Since it's so popular, Paris streets hold many cars. Now that the temporary law has passed, the amount of smog has dropped dramaticaly.

When cars aren't used, lives are saved. Car accidents happen very often and oftentimes they are fatal. When you have a car, you become able to get a DUI. Owning a car can bring you extensive fines, even when you make a small accident in a fraction of a second.

With the economy the way it is, who can even afford a nice car? Bikes are much cheaper and safer for people as well as the environment. If everyone in the world stopped using their cars for a month, we might be able to save a species from dying out, or maybe slow the desintegration of the ozone layer. In Yosemite, wolves flee from the roads because of the massive amount of death it causes their species.

Suburban cities are working on making everything walking distance. On the weekends, public transportation is free. If you have an electric car or you're carpooling three or more people, you're allowed to drive in these cities. Because of these new laws that are being tested in certain areas, many people don't have their licenses. Many teenagers today aren't concerned with being able to drive, and many adults live close enough to their workplace to walk there. Although the laws restricting driving can seem very restricting, they will save lives and will give society a chance to have a smarter, cleaner, and safer future.         ",2
0425a6e,"In this article the author is talking about going to Venus. The author explains the reasons why we should explore this planet. The author mentions that they should study Venus despite the danger it presents. Venus is the closest planet from the Earth in terms of density, size, and occasionally in distance too. Is Venus so inhospitable, why do scientist want to learn more of this planet? Venus has been proven a very challenging place to examine more closely.Why is it so important to visit Venus? What are the risks of going to Venus? What would the conditions be to go to Venus?

Venus is the second planet from our sun. Not even a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. Each previous mission was unmanned, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Studyng Venus is a challenge to humans. Venus atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Of any planet from our solar system Venus has the hotterst surface. Astronomers believe that Venus once was like Earth. In tis article it it mentioned that long ago Venus used to be covered lagerly by oceans and problaby had many forms of life. Venus still have certain characteristics that relate to the Earth like valleys, mountains, craters, and rocky sediments. Returning to Venus is indisputable, scientists and astronomers are trying to figure out the ways to make this mission safe and scientifically productive? The NASA has an idea to sending humans to study Venus. This idea would allow them to float above the fray, temperatures would still be at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However researchers cannot take samples of any kind from a distance. Nasa researchers are working on safer ways to study Venus. Reseachers are thinking in using old technology called mechanical computers. But why not use modern computers and more advanced technology?

Well modern technology is tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. This challenge is to human curiosity which will lead to equally intimidating endeavors.

In conclusion in order to visit Venus there are many dangers that could occur. But how the author suggested despite the dangers. In the article mentions many danger of visiting Venus and the ways reseachers are trying to find to visit Venus safe and to learn. Studying Venus would help humanity to discover new things.

There will be dangers in this challenge but it's worth it. The author explains why they should study Venus and give details and explains the dangers of this challenge.",3
0429d4a,"I'm against having driverless cars because I don't think that driverless cars will ever work properly without getting into a wreck on its own. The cars wouldn't even be driverless because it would have to have a person turn them into and out of a driveway or dealing with complicated issues dealing with traffic. You're not just assisting a car you are driving the car still. It isn't 100% on its own on the road you would still have to help steer at certain spots. Therefore they can't be trusted because you could be approaching a stoplight that has a lot of traffic and then your car wouldn't stop you would have to stop it before it caused a wreck.

I would feel much more safe if I had just a regular, normal car that I could drive 100% of the time. The only safe car is a car that has a person in it and driving it. If it was a choice between the driver or the manufacturer I would definately say that it was the manufacturer because a good driver wouldn't wreck, or get injured. The car would though because a self driving car couldn't work and would cause way more wrecks than what there are now. Therefore I would never let a self driving car drive me around.

Like I said it wouldn't even be 100% on its own just the driving straight part of it. The car wouldn't be able to turn or go into traffic on its own, but a person can. That's why I'm against Driverless Cars and why I don't think that any of them would work.",2
042b0cd,"State senator I ask that you favor the idea of keeping the Electoral College instead of changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

Even though the Electoral College is a despised method for choosing the president it has it's reasons. I'll show you why I am in defense of the Electoral College.

We need a president that would regard all of our interests and concerns. Someone can't just appeal to one region and expect to win because "".. a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president.""(source 3) due to no region having the amount to guarantee the electoral votes to elect a president. Dealing with votes it is a problem to have a run-off election. One of the concerns with Electoral College is that "".. voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" stated in source 2. But the Electoral College simplifies that problem with the electoral votes. Remarked in source 3 it says ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively.)"" without the Electoral College it would have complicated the election procces but thanks to the Electoral College reduces the complication and produces a clear winner.

To win, the majority of the states have a system that gives all the electors votes to the winning candidate except Maine and Nebraska having their own way of proportional representation which is explained in source 1. This gives the certainty of a result, for example in source 3 it says that "".. even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landside electoral-vote victory in that state"" this makes it highly unlikely for a tie. The Electoral College gives political balance to large states (population wise) higher the population the more problems, concerns ,or interests is needed to be attend to. Like how source 3 says "" .. a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...""

To me all these reasons should prove to you that even though the Electoral College has its problems it's benefits outweigh it. So being in favor of keeping the Electoral College is the right choice don't you think so too?    ",4
042dc86,"In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", the author makes great points for and against driveless cars. Some of his arugements for driveless are very interesting and definitly out weighs the cons of driveless cars. Threes three main points that he made for driveless cars and how fast we're coming closer to having them everywhere. With driveless cars you can have you car drive up to 25mph, brake when you're to close to another car, and they can also notify the driver if he or she isn't paying attention to the road. Everyday we're getting close and closer to having complete driveless cars!

In 2013 BMW made a car that can handle speeds up to 25mph and they also added a really inavaiting feature in it; The car has special touch sensors that alert you anytime you take your had off the wheel. There's so many benfits to this. Let say someone is speeding four times over the speed limit and you have to move out the way before they can hit you, with your hands being on the wheel and the car driving you can move out the way and take complete control of the car. Another example is if you were driving your son/daughter to their friend's house and you had to look for which house you can sit the car to do the driving while you're looking for the house and that alone can help a may reduces finder benders in neighbrohoods because the car can break when its getting close to another car all on its own.

Noitifcations. Some car companies have been trying to make cars that have a hands up flashing light on the windsheld when you take your hands off the when or aren't paying attention to the road. This idea can help pervent so many accendents and help improve drving skills.

In conclusion all these ideas and all this new terchonology in cars will help stop and lower the percentage of accidents dramaticlly. Anywhere from having the car break on its own to drving a certain speed limit while you look for your childs friend's house can help stop so many accidents. We are getting closer and closer to a safer drving age each and everyday.        ",3
0435f85,"The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.

The author says in paragraph 2 ,""Numerous factors contribute to Venuss reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question ""Why would any one want to go to Venus"" or you may say to yourself ""This is not any where that i would want to go."" The author also states in paragraph 3,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere."" This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The author states in paragraph 6 ,""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The author gives us tons and tons of reasons why it is not worth going to Venus.

From what I have read today I will never want to go to Venus. The author gave plenty of good reasons on why we should not go to Venus. It is not a place for humas as we have already read. So i feel as if the author did not do a good job supporting his claim on why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.",3
043d5a8,"I think that driverless cars are a great idea but are not yet a safe one. What happens if soembody gets in a car wreck while being in the driverless car? I'd sure hate to be the manufacturer of that car because I'd be losing a lot of money. Driverless cars arent a bad idea I mean, there can be many pros and cons, but no one is ever 100% sure that their idea is as good as it needs to be before they can sell it to people, especially when a human being would be putting their lives in the responibility of a man made machine.

Driverless cars can be good for many, mainly working people on the road. Say you are a business man/woman and have tons of work to do because your company or business relies on you to make your people look good. Well, theres been a bit of an interfence with your work and didn't have time, but on your way to work you can focus on paper work and anything else that is required and have it done while another co-worker had not completed their paper work on th ewy to work. All because you own a driverless car and can getg more done. But when you think about the cons of riding in a driverless car you get to thinking, ""well what if I'm focusing on business work and my driverless car crashes?"" Who will be responsible? The manufacturer of course, because there was some type of malfunction where the car doesn't respond correctly to the surroundings. Would you put your life in the programming of a driverless car? Yes, they'll save lots of time and money but how much more would the damages cost to trust a driverless car to get you places safely?

In many cases I guess you can say that riding in a driverless car would come in handy. Maybe they arent the best for the roads, but what about using them for tours around the city or maybe creating them to travel only at neighborhood speeds? I'm sure the manufacturers will find a more safe use for driverless cars or possibly a different type of driverlesss automobile. In the beginning, middle, and end I still think in my head that driverless cars are never going to be a legitimate guaranteed safety vehicle. ",2

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

I bielive this is a great idea because,it helps us with our emotions and communicate with others,and help teahers out with students.

043e1a0,"May 24, 2001 was the date it all started. When the ""Face on Mars"" conspiracy began. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling a region of Mars called Cydonia. The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

After a few days of the finding of the ""Face"" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see. They added a capition to the image that quoted ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors used the photo as a propaganda to get the publics attention to Mars, and it rsulted on good high notes. The ""Face of Mars"" became an pop icon from starring in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkut lines for 25years! Then to clear up that the ""Face"" didn't show signs of life Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped the same image ten times sharper and it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien momument after all. They tried another picture after people wouldn't believe the landform idea and the Martian came equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin said it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In conclusion the image of the ""Face On Mars"" sparked contrivsory in if it was a face or a natural landfrom. You had all the public believing it was a face and NASA saying it was a landform. This challenged NASA to prove that the face was indeed a landfrom. They got sharper images in where it clearly shows a butte/mesa. Although the public didn't believe in NASA it sure did make NASA have a reason for its reaseach. The shared their discoveries with everyone and the public responded.

To begin with, I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because it is more reliable than election by popular vote. When you vote for the presidential election you help select your state's electors when you vote for president of your choice because when you vote for your candidate your actually voting for your candidates electors. As stated in paragraph six in source one. Also these electors aren't just every day people they are carryfully selected to take place in these events. For example, you walk into your local precint to vote on the fourth year on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You enter your voting booth and vote for the president of your choice, so you think. You are actually voting for your states electors. so thats one of the reasons why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because it is more modern,accurate and reliable. Most people vote for the president of there choice becuase of what they say theyll while in presidency, or how good they look, rescent experince, and how much they like that perticular president. Do you really want some one who knows nothing about the president of thier choice but how good they look,to vote for the the next leader of our country. As stated in paragraph eight in source one it states that the electors represnt our vote and choosse president accordingley. For example, a women walks into her local pricent and decides to vote for the president that looks better that isnt an ancurate vote cause she just voted for the president she likes and what if want to run this country into the ground. so thats why I am in favor of keeping the electoral college.

To conclude, because the electoral college is more reliable and more accuerate is why i am in favor of keeping the electoral college. So on that fourth year on the tuesday after the first monday of november you go into to make your vote make a wise choice and remeber your voting for your state's electors.            ",3
044b201,"With the years, we have changing many things in our society. Since technology, by making new electronic devices, to things in our government, by making new laws and new things to help people in all the country. But, does that mean that we have to change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the presindet of the United States? In my point of view, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution. And there are many evidence to support that keeping the Electoral College is beneficial to our country.

According to the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of Romney. Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landsalide electoral vote vistory in that satate. This demostrates, how people accept the fact that they are voting the electors and then for the President and Vice president. This help people by making easily the hour of vote for a candidate.

However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this. For example, in the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, the author says that according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. (Posner, paragraph #16).

Another evidence from the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised mothod of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner,  is when he says ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"" (Posner, paragraph #19). That means that No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavely in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing huis plurality in states that he knows he will win. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" That highlights how the Electoral College is trying to helping people vote their candidates and feel safe and comfortables with them.

To conclude, despite the fact many people say that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting  a president, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution that helps our community to help people with thir desicions and make our life more comfortable and easy.

04575a9,"The Disadvantage of Facial Action Coding System

According to TechGen, about 72% of students in the United States get distracted from a technological device, this can be a cell phone, computer, smartwatches, and more. Everyone has at least on technological device. Schools worldwide should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a distraction to students, they are a waste of money, and certain students do not want to show their emotions without being told to.

First, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they can be considered a huge distraction for students. Students worldwide need to learn the materials that is needed in order for them to graduate, the Facial Action is not going to help them at all. Students will also be distracted by it, and they will have a hard time focusing on what is going on in the classroom. If schools put the Facial Action System in all of their classroom, then it's going to be harder to the teacher and/or professor to get the students engaged in the activity. This technological system can be a big waste of money for classrooms.

Next, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a waste of money. According to TechPort, technological devices are increasing every single day with more things being imported to them. Schools have better things to spend their money on, such as sporting equipment, new choices of food, and extension of school building. Putting this Facial Action Coding System in all classroom can be schools go in debt because they'll have a difficult time paying materials off. There are certain students who do not want to show off their emotions.

Finally, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because certain students do not want to show off their emotions without being told to. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Most of the time students do not want their classmates or teachers to know how they are feeling because it can be embarassing for them to know. Students can be going through a rough time, and it can be discouraging for them to go to classroom knowing that the teachers know how they are feeling.

According to Techop, 62% of all classrooms in the world have at least one computer or technological electronic in their classroom. The majority of the students have at least used a device in their classroom. Schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a distraction to students, they are a waste of money, and certain students do not want to show their emotions without being told to.

0459116,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able  to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.                                                                               ",5
045c7fb,"Bases on the passage I think it would be a good idea to have technology read your emotional expressions in the classroom. Then again students in the class room might not be okay with it. For example,if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow,and it can tell if your becoming confused or bored. Some of they reasons of why Eckon created the new technology might be a little to much of the kids that rather look at the walls and be bored.

In order to get students to want theis new technology, we need to make the school and the creator find more ways to get them to understand why we need it. Make them understand why we feel that we need it. Also give them reasons on why we feel it should be valuable. And what can happen if we did have this type of technolgy.

Since we live in a digital world i feel that people and the students do not really understand why it could be okay to hvae new technology to read your emotional expressions. I think we need this techology for more then one reason. We need this technology because lots of kid go home complaing about why they are stressing so bad. They also got home complaing about being bullied abd not ahve enough time to do their home. And i know teacher now these days try to find better ways to make kids not go home complaing about anything,because there are better ways to get through the problem.

I honestly think that if we did have this new technology to read kids emotioal expressions when would not have as much problems like we do now. It's not bad to try something new for once. Just think about how do you think teachers our school feel when were not paying attention to anything they be talking about. Or how they ask us a question and we have no idea what in the world is going on. Having tchnology would be great for our school,and for our teachers,because they need to know how we feel about they lesson were working on. Teachers also need to know how much kids know.

Having technology that could read your emotional expression would be a big deal. At least for meand the teachers I think,because for me I honeslty sometimes have no idea what in the world be going on when the teacher is talking the same time when i'm trying to get it in my head or understand it my self. Come on now the technology can help you in school. Why not try to have something helpful for you and for your teachers,let along your parnters also. I know yout parents get tried of you kids coming home complaing about how you have so much homework and how you have time to get any of it done. Well here's some help since you students talk about having so much home,not being able to get it done on time,and being bullied at school. Put your phone down and put your head in some books. I bet if you put your head in somes books then you won't be complaing about having some much homework,not being able to get it done on time,and be bullied everyday. Cell phone usage does cause drama and emotional problems. Technolgy to read students emotional expressions would be the best idea in the world to read students emotional expressions,because some kids need it. Even if they feel like they don't, i bet you they do. Not just for the teachers but for the parnters and theirsleves to.                  ",4
045fabf,"Would you think its interesting for computers to analyze your emotion? imagine a computer showing if you're sad, wouldn't that be cool? Well if you think thats cool, Dr. huang and his colleague are creating new ways to figure out people's emotions through computers!

That is a good idea because this could impact investigation, like cops figuring out who the're dealing with. For example, say there was a bank robbery and the criminals got away, but soon the cops found them and arrested them, they could either sit down with them and try and work their way around to see if the're is something wrong with them or they could just snap a picture and figure out thier expressions by using the FACS, (Facial Action Coding System). that would make it easier on investigators because the artical says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly"". using video imagery, the new software tracks the facial movements in a real face. This technolgy can improve how well things are animated too, like on tv, and video games. overall i think this is a gonna impact so many cool things that is still to come.

The FACS is gonna change alot of things in a positive way, its going to improve ivestigation and recgonizing different facial expressions to those who are either really happy or really sad and depressed. ",2
045fec2,"Would driverless cars really be helpful to people if they were successfully made? They would probably turn out to be something great if manufacturers succeeded in making these cars. Cars like these sound just as good as flying cars in the future. However, driverless cars do not seem to be a good thing for society. There could be a few problems if this type of car was created and here are some of those problems.

Driverless cars are not good for the society if they are made. Firstly, people would be more lazy than they already are if introduced to this. We already have sensors to help us with driving, so what more do we need. People are already lazy enough today because of technology. This idea would not help society at all if it were introduced to us.

Secondly, in paragraph nine, they state that if one were to be in a car accident, on one will really know who is at fault. In addition to that, people could lie, saying that it was the car's fault, thus people would blame the manufacturers. There could be a lot companies sued because of car accidents and of people who do not want to tell the truth. Also, what happens when a driverless car hits a pedestrian? Driverless could do a lot of bad things and it would all fall on top of the company.

Lastly, there is truly no point in making driverless cars because the driver is not doing a lot in the first place. People know how to drive already and there is no point in making a car that does everything that the driver can already do. This goes back to the laziness part. People also know that there's no point, but yet they decide we should have it because of their laziness. These are some reasons on why driverless cars are not good for society.

Driverless are not a good idea and should not be introduced to society. Honestly, it would step up our game with technology, but we should not waste with something like a driverless car. We can do so much more with this kind technology and should not take it for granted. We should be using our brains for thinking of a way to stop global warming or even the flying car idea sounds nice. To cnoclude, creating driverless cars is not a good idea.   ",3

0467e2a,"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns,  banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay $40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".  This new form of seperate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"".  passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States.  With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".  Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it.  Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted.  Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars.  The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, 'the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four.  Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries.  Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies.  Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage.  New York started a new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing.  They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new eco-friendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.    ",4

046e84a,"Unmasking the Face on Mars

The ""face"" on mars has been a very common or popular story, when 25 years ago viking 1 spacecraft snapped a photo of what looked like a two mile long ""face"" that seemed to be staring back at the camera. Many were suprised and shocked at the sight and many conspiracy theorist belived it was a alien artifact but scientist found and believed it was an martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. It takes the shape of a face but also unusual shadows made it out to look like an egyptian pharoh when mesa's were more commonly found proving the ""face"" theory uncredible.

At NASA we feel like the ""face"" found on mars is just a natural land mark or a mesa. At NASA we think it is a lava that takes form as an isolated mesa. Although it looks like a face and some theories say it is bona fide evidence of life on mars, we have factual evidence to believe it is a mesa like in the snake river plain in Idaho and also commonly found on Cydonia around where the ""face"" was.

Yes, the landmark resebles a face and shadows make out a eyes, nose and mouth shape to also contribute to the illusion that it could be thought of as proof of aliens or alien civilizations on mars but, there is really no for sure credible evidence that could explain and prove it is an 100% acual bona fide face. It is more likely and more proven to be a simple mesa such as some of the mesa landmarks on earth. Along with the people who feel it is an alien artifact some scientist also believed it was indeed an alien artifact also but sadly it is not altough at NASA we wish we could uncover an Alien civilization on Mars.

In conclusion, this ""face"" is nothing more than a Martian equivilent of a mesa or butte. Although the popular suspition and popularity of it being a ""face on Mars"" it is nothing more than a landform that is also common around the American West. Not only that but, Skeptics and authors felt it would be a good way to attract attention to Mars which could lead to the truth being streched without physicl evidence to back up their theories.",3
046efe7,"I belive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not possible for people to live on Mars, there are no such thing as aliens, and why would there just be a head shape object and not the rest of the body. In the passage it says, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Also how could there be life on Mars. Mars has no oxygen so people can breathe. All NASA wanted to do was ,"" engage public and attract attention to Mars."" also in the text it states that NASA said,"" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shodows giving the illusionb of eues, nose and mouth.""

The Face on Mars is not real because it is just a natural landform caused by erosion and broken rocks. An example from the text is, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.""

Secondly another reason the Face is a nautural landfrom is because it is not possible for people to live on Mars. Studies have shown that there is no oxygen on Mars and people can not breathe there. Also the preasure of the gravity on Mars would be too much for a human and could crush their bones and musles. Thirdly, why would the rest of the body not be with the Face. That proves that the Face is just a natural landfrom create by erosion and rocks because if the Face was there on the ground why wouldnt the rest of the body by with the Face.

In conclusion the face is just a natural landfrom becuase NASA have send rovers up to Mars to take pictures of the Face and NASA said themselves,""when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. So that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Also in the text it states,"" New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.""        ",3
047a377,"The use of technology suchas, Facial Action Coding system, is totally uneccessary in the classroom setting. Claiming that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' "" is an ineffective way to to really, truly get through to the students. Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. In the article, it says "" we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day"". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is uneccessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. In the article is says "" ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucor' ""

The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with.

The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us but we grow closer to the destination every day.Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless can to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream.

Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down.

On the positive side these driverless car might be a good idea for someone that's always is on the go & they get tired of driving. It may also be good for the mothers of young children. Only when the child is crying the can have the car driving it's self while they get the baby in order. They should really make that a feature of the car. Other than that the car seems worthless & is just another car problem that us Americans would have.

Then we have the negative & I could go on & on about this one. Now having a driverless is just insane & lazy. First off what is the point of having a car if it's just going to drive it's self? I think it would cause more accident & like the article said; who's fault would it be the would the accident be on? Then insurance would be at an all time high, because the makers of these cars are going to find everyway to make these more advanced then the next, like I said in the first paragraph how much EXACTLY would it cost to buy A car like this or even fix a car like this ? Literally us as people only make enough to support our families & pay the bill. Having to buy these cars would be another thing to break us.

Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and polution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care alot about making and having alot of benjamins (

money

). Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our polution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country. I know it will change it and make it better!               ",4

I just writing what I know how to right this doen't really matter because imma fail anyways but this story wouldn't really valuable why because I know our generation and if we have it in our school no one would care. I wouldn't here one person say ""hey lets check out the FAC"" because I know what im saying I would like to speak the truth.

0499982,"My position on driverless cars is that I am a against the development of these cars. My three reasons why I don't agree with this is because they don't do all the driving, not all drivers will be paying attiontion, and people won't need to get a lissions or need there permit and it will break the cartural of driving.

The car dosn't drive all by itself you will to take over if there is work zones or if there is accidents. Since it dosn't drive on work zones or by acciedents how would you knowif there is one? What if you sleeping? If your going on a high way and your sleeping on a long road trip and there is an accendent ahead of you or there is work zones you wouldn't possable know and you will be ending up in a accedent.

This leads to my second reason that not all drivers will be paying attintion on the road since the car will be driving by it self they won't no need to be looking at the road. They will be busy on there phone or be sleeping. This will cause alot of increase of accidents if diviers don't payattintion while the car is driving. Also it will increase alot of accidents in teens since they will be on there phone and wouln't care whats going on.

My last reson is that people won't need a permit or a lissions anymore.This could be dangrous. Since the car is going to be doing all the work there isn't a point of passing the permit test if your not taking the wheel, or the lisson test of driving the car because your not going to be driving its the car. This will affect us because we never know the people out there and can't trust them all.

This is why I dissagree in the driverless cars. This will affect us and cause more accidents and people won't be paying atintion.This is why I dont think agree with this.   ",3
04a4399,"The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools to help students. There are benefits to this system, but the bad outweigh the good. This technology used to reconize emotions will affect students in ways that aren't necessary, and cause unwanted problems in the classroom.

Firstly, the article metions this system being used on computers while students are working to analyze their emotions. The author writes "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (Alto 6). Having a computer watch students' facial expressions while working could make the students feel uncomfortable and give them anxiety. Being uncomfortable while working will effect the way a student learns. They will not be focusuing on the material they are learning, but instead the idea that they are being watched. This is a problem that's not needed in the classroom and can be avoided.

Secondly there are tons and tons of emotions a human can express. The author writes "" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (Alto 3). Having only classified six emotions, is not a very wide range. What if for example, a student were to show an emotion that the computer doesn't have programmed and reconizes it as somthing else, changing the lesson to fit the wrong emotion? This would cause the lesson to be changed when the student didn't need it to be. This creates a technology problem along with the problem of fixing the lesson and wasting time the student could be using to learn.

Lastly, having a computer analize a students emotions while working would leave the teacher with nothing to teach or help the students with. This might seem like a good thing at first, but teachers create the classroom atmosphere and keep students ingaged in learning. Why have a computer analyze student emotions when teachers have been doing it perfectly for years?

The Facial Action Coding System is a great advance in technology, but when it comes to schools, the System should not be used. It only creates problems that are not needed. These problems could be avoided by not using the system.",4

04a99cb,"""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""

Dear Senator I strongly suggest you on changing to election by popular vote and getting rid of the Electoral College. As you can see on the quote above people really don't like the Electoral College. This would be a very wise decision because the Electoral College is very old and unfair and it cause many crisis to happened.

First and foremost the Electoral College is very old.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. Also the electoral college sometimes causes many crisis.

It states in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is that we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows for much worse.""

This quote explains how the electoral college caused a fiasco in 2000 because of the electoral college and if we don't get rid of it we could have another one of these crisis.

On the other hand the electoral college should not be taken away because our founding fathers established it.

It states in the article ""Source 1: What is the Electoral College?"" ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

This quote illustrates how the electoral college is suppose to help us and noy hurt us. Also our founding fathers established so they were just trying to get everything in order and have peace with everyone.

Although the electoral college is very unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""At the most basic level, the electoral coolege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on only the tight race in the ""swing"" states.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is unfair and doesn't give chances to other states that supposively have no chance on voting for that certain canditate.

All in all Senator the electoral college must be abolish. Not only does it create many disasters, but it is very unfair to us citizens. The electoral college is very old and we should give a break. We could start with something fresh like the popular vote and see how it turns out. As you can see there is many evidence on how the electoral college is bad and that you should give the popular vote a chance.    ",3

04af97d,"Driverless should not be used under any condition. Driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. We should never risk ourselves or others just because we are lazy and dont wanna drive. If we left everything to these driverless cars many pepole could die. Driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets.

To begin, Driverless are carless. Driverless cars can not stay allert like a human can. In the passage it states, ""They can steer, accerlate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". This shows that a Driverless cars just does not have what it takes to be out on the road. If a kid ran in the middle of the street, unsuspectingly, the car would not have time for the human to take over and the kid would be severly injured or worse. It just is not worth the risk.

In addition, Driverless cars are not advanced enough. Driverless cars may have sensors and take extra steps in safty but technology just is not there. The pasage says, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". In the future we may have the power we need to have driverless cars, but in this time now we do not. Many states even have laws that will not allow driverless cars to even be tested in that states.

Finally, They are not reliable. All technology has flaws and that can not be helped. The passage even states, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver ot the owner?"". This is a good point, The car technology may seem flawless, but many factors come into play with something this big. The car may have a maulfunction that no one could have predicted, and many pepole could be injured or killed. This driverless car just is not reliable enough to risk the lives of innocent.

Driverless cars are a very nice idea and would be helpful, However driverless cars just are not safe. These driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. Many factors play in even ones we can not fully predict when it comes to technology. Its not worth the risk of pepole getting hurt just because we get lazy and do not want to drive. Theres no way to avoid it; its just safer to relie on ourselves instead of a robot.",4
04b354e,"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" (Office Of Federal Register 6), the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair. The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.

The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare"";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.

Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. The  tie-breaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" (Plumer 12). This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.

Entering the booth next election day, dont only think about who you are voting for, but also how you are voting for them. It makes all the difference, and, ultimately, the popular way is the best way.    ",5
04b4ad6,"""Out travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers or doubt"" The author of this article belives that it's worthy to study Venus no matter the dangers we could be face to face with.

In the article the author states we should travel beyond despite all the dangers we could come across. This author supports his idea by stateing that we could go beyond our imagination and innovation. NASA is working on sending humans to go and study up closely Venus. I think we should study different planets only if we are not faced with any danger in our way, this way we know if most of the planets are survivable.

In the article the author states if and when we arrive to Venus it could be tough desicion and with unease conditions but it could be survivable for humans. Radiation would be one of the dangers we would have to face. Another aspect that would make the conditions on Venus uneasy would be the fact that air pressure could get us really ill if and when we travel there.

In my opinion i think the opportunitiy of traveling to any other planet such as our neighbors Mars and Venus are a great way to go above and beyond out of our planet. This would be such a great opportunity

for us to travel to different planets, then again if we dont come acroos any dangers.

This would be a great exploration for us to send humans to study other planets as the author states and when we do, we will know what we are up againist.      ",3

When they scanned Mona Lisa's face she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry.

Now if people start turnning towards this method of telling how people feel instead of asking them to make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that's not okay. If you want to now how someone feels don't make a 3-D model of their face to have a computer tell you just go up and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better. It amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead of face to face converstations.

Fianally if you scan someones face to see if you can make them feel better than you are doing it all wrong. You need to walk up to that person and say ""Are you okay, what do you need to help you"". Also when you do scan someones face they can put on whats called a ""Fake Smile"" and trick the computer into thinking it's a actual smile, so it will say they are happy when in reality you are mad or upset.

04bc9b6,"Face On Mars

Have you ever wondered if there was possibly other life forms out there, living on other planets? In 1976, NASA'S spacecraft ""Viking 1"" was circling Mars and taking photos. Suddenly, it spotted a form that almost looked like a human face. Some conspiracy theorists assume and consider it to be evidence of other life forms, while NASA knows it's just another landform on Mars. It's common to have forms like that around Cydonia, it's also proven that there is no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually show that it's a martian similar to land forms here on Earth. All the evidence NASA has brought upon us has proven that it is just another land form on Mars.

Firstly, it is common around Cydonia to have land forms as such. NASA

has taken plenty of pictures of Mars to know that it's quite common for there to be land forms like this. Although it may have unusual shadows, NASA could only wish that there would be possible evidence of ancient civilization on Mars. It being common, creates a slimmer chance of it being crafted by other life forms.

However, when Mars Global surveyor in April 5, 1998, Michael Malin was able to snap pictures with his Mars Orbiter Camera team. These pictures were much more clear. When the image was first revealed on a JPL web site, they realized it was only a natural landform. There was no alien monument to be seen. This strong evidence shows that with a clear image, there is no sign of any alien monument.

Furthermore, the pictures show that it's a Martian equal to a butte or mesa lanforms, seen around the American West. This evidence clearly shows that it's related to Earth land forms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This Earth landform is only a lava dome. The height is similar to the height to the face on Mars. These landforms being equal, show that it's normal to have land forms such as the Face on Mars.

But, perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze, and there could be possible evidence that aliens are indeed out there. Maybe a closer look into the image would clearify these statements. However, as likely as it sounds, the pictures taken were accurate, with an advanced camera.

Nevertheless, the chances of this Face on Mars being created by aliens is proven false. NASA

may hope that someday they might discover evidence of other life forms. Until then, they have supporting explanations on why it's not. For it to be common to have land forms like the Face on Mars, gives enough clearification. As well as, there being no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually showing a land form similar to ones on Earth. We never know what the future holds, so will NASA ever discover facts that support the conclusion of there being life on other planets?    ",4
04c4f26,"Dear,state senator

The Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you.

The first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors.

This being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust. When they take these chances they are setting themselves up for disaster.

I hope that you take what I said into consideration. These are just a few of the things that are wrong with the Electoral College system. Its only a matter of time before people like me start to realize everything wrong with the system we have now, and when they do realize the things wrong with it, they will want something done about it. Please help get a better system going and end this Electoral College crap we have now.            ",3

They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when theroad ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" If these cars were really driverless, they wouldn't need a driver to help them navigate. Are these cars really driverless? No.

Are these cars going to run on gas or electricity? Either way, these cars not start. A car stalls all the time, but those cars we handle, but what about cars that are driverless? Would we know how to fix it or would we have to spend hundreds to get it fixed? These cars will cost hundreds to get fixed over and over again. Who wants to do that? I wouldn't mind having to charge it but then my electricity bill will be over the top expensive.

Would our kids be safe to be in the cars? What happens if our kids are playing and the car starts and the kid gets hurt or even dies? Would it be your fault or the car producers? It woul be everyone's. Ours, for not protecting our kids well enough and the car producers because they didn't think of the children.

04d13e6,"Having a driverless car may be the gretest or the worst thing someone could have. I am not against on driverless cars because they can be safe, prevent texting and driving accidents, and they alert you when you need to take control of the car. Not only because they drive themselves mean that they are amazing, it can just help to prevent accidents more often.

Driverless cars may be safer than an actual person driving. A mother may have to give the bottle to the baby because it won't stop crying and the car can take care of driving while the mother feeds the baby. Maybe they are listening to music and are more into the music than into the driving. A driverless car can take care of pressing the brake at the right time to stop before something happens. Also that person may not be in good conditions to drive the car and need to get to a doctor or something. That would be if there isn't something else out there that will have to make you take control of the car.

These driverless cars alert you when you need to take the wheel and control it yourself. It is a good thing becuase they probably know that they can't drive through what is happening. Like said in the passage, their can be a traffic jam or there can be an accident and that would be a reason why the car will alert you. It would be a bad thing that the car wouldn't tell you when to take over because it would just stop working all of the sudden and that would't be good. But what would be good is to prevent you from having a accident while texting.

Many teens and even adults now text while driving. They feel like if they don't respond at that instant moment the world is going to end or something. A driverless car can prevent that becuase it can be driving itself and you could answer a call or a text and then get back to driving. The car can prevent you from having an accident from not paying attention to the road. Also maybe you can't find your phone and it keeps on rinigng and it distracts you so the car can take care of the driving while you search for the phone.

In conclusion having a driverless car can be a great thing because you can respond an emergency text without having a fear of dying, it can be safe for you and passengers, and it alerts you when you need to take control. It can be a good thing for the future because more and more technology comes out each year and we are always amazed by everything we see.  ",3
04d2b73,"Do you really need a computer to express your emotions? Updates in technology have found ways for a computer to track facial movements to detect human emotion. This allows computers to detect your emotions before you do. We are told to answer if this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that this techonlogy is not valuable in a classroom.

My first reason for thinking its not valuable is because it doesn't provide any benefits to the classroom. Why does our expression or emotion need to be known by the teacher or computer? Education doesn't have to be amusing or easy. Thats the point of learning. Emotion isn't taken in to consideration when we are assigned homework.

Secondly, my reason for disagreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because looks are decieving. Let's say for example a stuent is doing perfectly well on their assessment and sees how much time has gone by. They are confused, but only for a second. This is sent to the instructor as a message of confusion on the topic. This has caused an unnessisary interuption on the assesment. Computers can't detect every emotion, and they surely can't detect where the cause of that emotion is coming from.

In contrast to my argument, one could say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions gives us an davantage. For example ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. I would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they should ask questions. Also, it is natural to not take interest in the lesson. Boredom is commom in school, but that should not impact the ability to learn.

In conclusion, the technology provides no real benefits to a classroom, neither to a student. Bringing this technology to a classroom would be a waste of time. Emotions are decieving in school and don't have to be acknowledged by a computer. This is why I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",4
04d3f9c,"Venus is worthy pursit despite the damage it presents. Venus is worthy pursit despite the damage it presents because it was once the earths like planet in the solar system. Another reason is because Venus was once covered by oceans. The last reason is because they want to understand why no spaceship has ever made it to Venus to actually try to get samples and other stuff to study it.

Venus was once the earths like plante in the solar system. Scientists want to study venuse even though it dangers to see why its not like it use to be. The old venus was just like earth years ago but then it started changing with the years. In the passage it said that "" Astronomers are fascinatesx by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earths-like planet in out solar system"" (Paragraph 4, Sentence 2). This means that they are really into the thing that Venus was once like Earth. They want to keep studying it until they have something to compareit to Earth with.

Venus was once covered by oceans years ago. Another reason why sciantists want to study Venus is because Venus was once covered with bodies of water and want to see why that changed. In the passage it said that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (paragraph 4, sentence 3). This means that they are really fasinated by the way that Venus just went from being bodies of water to having eruptions of volcanoes all the time and earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All these stuff have changed Venus completly and they want to figure out why.

Scientists want to understand why not one single spaceship has made it to Venus without falling apart. In the passage it says that "" Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (Passage 2, Sentance 6). This means that they have not been able to make any spaceship land on Venus. Maybe it could be the 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus has or the acid in the atmosphere that Venus has. All the spaceships have not survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is also working on other stuff so they can approach Venus such as electronics made of silicon carbide and has lasted for three weeks.

In conclusion people think that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. One reason for that is because it was once the earths like planet in the solar system. Another reason is because Venus was once covered by oceans. The last reason is because they want to understand why no spaceship has ever made it to Venus to actually try to get samples and other stuff to study it.      ",4
04d409d,"Having driverless cars into our life is one less problem that we have to worry about in our daily life. It will help our life get so much easier, because you might not have to worry about fuel prices or driving to places when you're tired. Also it will help reduce the number of teenage's death, because most of the death of teen are cause by car crashed. It's good for those who travel a lot, because as a driver you don't have to drive all the way to the destination. By having Driverless Cars into our life, it'll save money, help reduce the cause of teenage death and it help to drive for you when you're tired and need to take a rest for a bit.

First of all, I think it's a great idea to have driverless car, because it helps reduced the death of teen. In American, almost most of the death of teenager are caused by texting while driving. Although many organizations tried to tell teenager to ""Stop Texting while Driving"", it is not effective, because in these day more teen are being pressure by technology whether it is in TV or Internet and they want to be cool. That's why having Driver less can help reduced the death rate. For example, if you're driving and text message pops up, you can let the car drive by itself and text. In paragraph 2, it said that the cars have been driven more than a million miles without a crash which mean that teens and young adult can let the car drive for a couple hours and text which can save their life. Not only does it can help reduced the car crash rate, it can also help you save money.

""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus."" If they do succeed on letting driverless car legal, it would help individual so much. Traveling is fun things but nowaday not many people travel or goes to roadtrip anymore because one of the main problem is that they don't have the expenses to paid for the fuel or spending too much on fuel can decrease the amount of money they can save. If they do secceeded on having the driverless car and the fuel cost less to use it, then it would be great for many people. More people will be able to save money. Not only that, it will greatly help with the growth of our economy.

Last but not least, the function of the car is beyond our senses, because not only does it drives by itself but it can also elert driver when someting is wrong. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead required human skill"" paragraph 7. In case of emergency whereas the car are not capable of functiong need the driver to take over, it can elert the driver to take over. Also in paragraph 7 it said, ""This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drive's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed drive's seats that vibrate when vehicles is in danger of backing into an object"" So, when it required the drivers to drive, it can vibrate their seat to get their attention. I think it's a great idea to have that in it because it can prevent running into conflicts.

To conclude that having driverless car can help reduced the death of teenagers and young adult. The car can take over when people need to text or make a phone call, and it can drive for you when you're distracted by your surrounding that you can focus on the roads which can help reduced the chance you'll have accident. Not only that, it can help you save money. By spending less in the fuel, you can keep some change in your pocket. Also it can help drive for you when you got to sleep or take a nap if you're in long roadtrips. It support safety for the drivers, whereas the system elert the driver if the car encounter a problem and needed the driver to take over. That's why having driverless car can help our daily life and improved the way we live.",4
04da4bf,"Have you heard about FACS? Its full name is glory is ""the Facial Action Coding System"".It basically allows to tell which emotion the persons feeling. It seems like a great and wonderful device to have in work places and school places! I think we/they should have these devices in places that best need them! Like in and out the classroom.

I think its valuable because when your in a classroom teachers tend to ususally do a lesson even though all the students get bored out of their minds and end up not paying atention!! Same goes for doing a lesson on this computer, the classroom would be able to recognize the students emotions if the school had some of thses devices, but right now we don't because not all schools cant afford new high tech computers to recognize the childrens emotions! In the text it states

""A classroom computer could recognize when a studenr. Hat is becoming cinfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure! With this it would probably take a while but easy t the same time, because there are so much combinations to this peice of technology! In the text it staes ""he facial expressions for each emotion are univeral,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Like not smiling as broadly). This tells that there are so many emotions to decode! Now how this works is the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and detects all your muscles in your face to determine what emotion your in. In the text so far states that Eckman has classifed 6 basic emotions and they are; happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, this mechine would be most useful in classrooms because teachers and computer programs can change up so that the students would not be so bored and not pay attention! So they correct their lessons and can make it entertaining and fun for everyone!",3
04db8d6,"We have a Universe full of uncertainties and dangers. Since that is the case, should we just give up trying to discover new things? No, of course not, Then why should Venus be any different. It might be a risky and dangerous job but, this might also be a golden opportunity to, maybe find out connections between Venus and our Earth.

Astonomers believe that Venus used to be an Earth-like planet long ago. There are actual some features now on Venus that resmbles to Earth wiith familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and even craters. Furthermore, let us not forget the fact that Venus also sometimes is our nearest option for a plantery visit. That should be more than enough reason to try and study more of Venus. One day we might need that information, so better safe then sorry.

Lastly, even though is will be difficult scientist are already figuring out safer options to study Venus, like hovering over the planet to gather intel without a real big risk. And even getting electronics tested for Venus's harsh climate. It might be difficult but, where would we be if we just gave up trying to discover new things when things get tough.                 ",3
04dbd25,"Limiting car usage could come off as absurd to some people. They ask ""Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?"" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more conveinient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevelant in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have possitive effects on the environment.

The greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowldge that the Earth is in a state of self-destruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmuful emissions come from cars and other gas-powered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of grenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the  United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environemnt that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article ""The End of Car Culture."" The article states that a limit to car usage would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions."" This article does not only say that cars are  large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.

Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous.                    ",4
04defeb,"Many people believe that this face on Mars was made by an Ancient Alian Race that once lived on Mars. This Face was discivered 25 Years ago on a space Expedition. Most NASA scientisis believe that this Face on Mars is a natural land form but, some believe that it is not natural and was formed by Alians. Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural.

Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way.

Scientisis have been researching the Face on Mars for years abd have come up with a reasonal explination for why the Face on Mars was not created by Alians and is a natural land formation that is created the same way as some formations in the Western United States. Though Scientists would like to have proof that there was a race of martians that lived thousands of years ago there is logical information prooving that this was a natural formation that is also experienced on Western Regions of the United States.

04df837,"""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesnt really list any benefits to exploring Venus.

Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to.

Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. The author writes "" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?

In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.",4

I know every show that I have seen, that has to do with driverless cars has proved a big point, and I have learned something I needed to about car safety. But completly driverless cars are a problem. we cant have a car without at least one human looking over it to make sure it stops doing something that it doesnt need to at a reliable time.

Driverless cars are a team thing between technology and men, we have to work togther for it all to work properly.

04e1cec,"Have you ever been really bored of something, but your teacher in class can't tell? The Facial Action Coding system can be enabled on computers that can identify human emotions. There have been many scientists and researchers that are working on this so it can detect your emotions by the muscles in your body. It is kind of like when you are trying to detect a friends emotion because you can tell how they are feeling.

Imagine this a system that can read your emotions based on your facial expressions that is based off of facial muscles. This is something we already kind of do when we try to tell a friends facial expressions. This is something that we humans should be happy to have we hate being bored and a computer would be able to tell that we are, so it would never play that video or ad again which would make it would modify the lesson for each person according to Huang. Also if you really liked that video or ad that was just played they would play simliar ones to it.

Dr. Huang also explains that most communication is non verbal in fact most of our communication is non verbal.

So, what is the Facial Action Coding System you might be thinking. Well the facial action coding system is a computer that constructs a 3d model of each persons face. This must take a while since we do have 44 major muscles in our face. This computer is basically supposed to be able to detect at least the 6 main basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The machine can do so by it can tell the characteristic movements of each facial muscle. The article describes like when you raise your eyebrows you show surpise and when the muscles around your lips it shows anger. This can be benificial in a lot of ways especially when it can tell that you don't like something. Also humans might try to guess facial traits, but we can't describe each facial trait someone has.

Surely you are thinking that a machine can't detect somebodies emotions, but it could detect that the Mona Lisa she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful, and

2% angry. The machine might have some faults at first, but surely if they can make something like that they could improve it. This could be what humans need something or somebody that actually knows how we feel. If that's not convincing if we have psychologists that can detect our emotions based on our smile why can't they help the people coding these machines and get everything right.

In conclusion, is there a machine that can detect our feeling. There could be something or someone that can help in the near future, but currently this is just a project. This is something that could be in the future that will replace our current computers and/ or our smartphones. This is a start to something that could reveal al lot about us, our faces, and our emotions. ",3
04e6cd8,"""The Face""

Have you ever saw something so strange you just had to get a picture of it?! Well if you have, ive done the same! It all started 25 years ago around Mars!

Mission controllers back at the Jet Propulison Lab had to be really suprised of what we have found on Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling aound Mars and found a figure similar to a human face, believe me when i say it, Yes a human face!!!Although scientists found out it was just an Martian Mesa, i still find it pretty cool!

A few days after the photo's were taken, NASA has decided to show everyone and let everyone know about this Matian mesa.The caption resembled a human head. The author thought it would be a good idea to attract attention to mars, and it slowly, but surely did!

The human face like structure has became a pop icon, it has appeared in many places and thing such as a film, magazines, talk shows, apppeared in some books, it even made it to the grocery sotre checkout lines ofr 25 years!!That is a really big deal for just a structure on mars!!Certain people thought the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, which is there own opinion.

Global Surveyor as known as (MGS) went ot the Red Planet on September 1997, 18 long years after the Vikings missions ended. On April 5,1998 Michael M. and his Mars Orbiter camerea as known as (MOC) snapped a picture 10 times better then the Vikings!!Also for the first

time, Mars Global Surveyor flow over Cydonia. Come to find out, there was no alien monument after al!But no everyone was satisfied with this photo.

The camera was really bad considering it had to go through wispy clouds just to see the face.Mission controllers prepaired to look at it again.After a while Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a 2nd look on april 8, 200l. What the picture really had shown was a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, they have all been fooled.",2
04ea96d,"presidents are elected every four years. Some presidents make changes some presidents don't, society  strongly believes any president elected should make good changes. Any citizen from any state want's the president elected to make a difference, thats clearly one of the presidens duites. Presidents sometimes do not compensate for the mistakes they make that they're not supposed to make. Citizens votes should be the votes counted for electing presidents and not couted for electing electors.

To begin with, most presidnets elected most of the time make no difference and citizens are not content. Presidents have many duties to complete and of them is to make changes and make the world a better place for all citizens. in the article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner he states ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" what the author clearly states is that society is not voting for a presidential candidate but for a slate of electors. This is why most of the time society is not content with the president chosen and bad changes are made. Citizens are the ones who live in this country so they should be the one's who's votes are counted for electing presidents so that they do not suffer the next four years.

To continue, some presidential candidates intentions to society are harmful and do not help them in anyway possible. Presidents intentions while on their four years of being presidents are supposed to help society and make their life easier and not worse. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer he states ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Somtimes."" this quote shows that not only is society not voting for the presidential candidate they are in favor of but they cant even control who their electors vote for sometimes. Citizens in anyway possible can not vote for the presidential candidate they are in favor of so that means society will not be content for four years and changes will be made that will make their lifes harder and some priveliges will be taken away if the presidents intentions are not helpful. Society will be living in hell in other words.

It's every fun, it allowed me to go on adventures and vist unique places like Greece, Venice, Italy, and I even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are also others things to do besides go to different places when you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Even though you get free time there is also work to do. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I just couldn't say no, I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime. Let me give you some reason on why you should join.

Like i said before there are others things you have to do when participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One thing is you have to take care animals. Everytime I found it fun taking care of the animals, especially on when I returned from trips and the animals had been unloaded. There were different types of animals on board like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. Once there was even a cargo with 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

My next reason is you also get to play games on the ship. The cowboys and I played baseball, volleyball games, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games helped us pass time when we didnt have work to do. Sometimes we would even play games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would even have different types of tournaments.

The most important and my last reason is that while in the Seagoing Cowboys we had to help different people with things. We had to help them with animals, food, and we had to help on the ship. There were many things we had to do on the ship like be watchmen, check the animals every hour, and make an hourly report to the captain. There is a lot of work you have to put in into being a Seagoing Cowboys even if you do get hurt. But it will be all worth it in the end.

I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It was very fun for me, so if i had fun being one then I feel like you will to. You will have a lot of fun trust me. ",3
04ef8ff,"After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it made me inclined to think that a driverless car would be a benefical thing to have. They could potentally reduce driver made accidents and make the roads run safer and smoother than they do today.

Some people may believe that driverless cars are dangerous, but they may not realize that safety is one of the major concerns that manufacturers have. They still plan on having the driver maintain alert and ready to take control of the car if needed. In paragraph 7, the writing states that, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This leads me to believe that these cars are safe.

There are still some issues involving the driverless cars. Such as figuring out who is at fault if there is an accident. Would the driver in the car or would the manufacturer of the car be held responsible? These are good questions, but the writing says that, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Which means that chances are the laws will change and the people will decide what the future laws of the driverless cars will be.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless cars are going to be made no matter what. The car manufacturers are continuing to make imporvements to the cars sensors and computers everyday. The article even says that, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" So, driverless cars are going to happen, and they are going to happen soon.",3

04f47a5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author includes many benefits and dangers that come with exploring Venus. Venus is known for its uninhabitable atmosphere and environment, but scientists believe that long ago Venus was the planet most similar to Earth. In this article, the author believes that humans should go beyond the limits of dangers and supports his or her idea well with inspiring points that motivate anyone to look past the boundaries. The author lists the extreme dangers of Venus, and then answers why scientists are so set on exploring it.

The author first regards the dangers of Venus. The author explains the problem to finish with a promising solution. The author gives dreadful facts that prove the planet is extremely inhospitable for any human and even some space crafts. The author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" The author does not say this to frighten anyone but to blunty state what the NASA scientists are up against.

Further into the article, the author answers the important question ""why?"" Why would anyone want to put themselves at these risks? Why is Venus worth all of the trouble? The answer is, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author wants people to realize that Venus has the potential to be almost identical to Earth, but the author also includes that scientists cannot be certain without further exploration. The potential of Venus being another part of our world is certainly going to excite many astronaunts and explorers to go make it certain.

Venus has the potential to hold an exciting new world, but the dangers astronaunts and scientists must face are lethal. The author paints a new possibility in this article by describing the potential Venus could hold. This article clearly shows how the author informs about the dangers of Venus but then answers why the scientists are to eager to get to know this planets. With the way the author gives inspiring points about exploring this planet, anyone can look past the dangers and see a new world.  ",4

Driverless cars are for the lazy people, they're for people who don't wanna drive they just want to sit back and let the car drive for them. If that was the case they wouldn't have gotten their license to drive. In the future licenses wouldn't be a thing if driverless cars are around , there's no need for one if the car just lets you sit there and watch it drive every where,that's just wasted time to get your permit then wait a few months and then get your license for driving.

Before putting any real driverless cars into the real world they should round alot of tests , because they should want everything perfect no messups or anything because that can be very dangerous if the cars system isn't programmed right or anything .

If you believe that the nearly two mile formation was staring back at the cameras was a face, the main reason this formation could not possibly be a formation of a face created by another life form on a different planet is because there is no scientific evidence of aliens to be discovered.

The Face has recieved national recognition as being a representative for most pop icons, Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. But because the Face is a popular icon, the way the face is portrayed to have been created and used for has been taken out of context by audiences around the world. Spin-off series about the Face and aliens have promoted the idea that aliens are real, although there is no scientific evidence to be found. The media that used the Face has promoted audiences to believe that the Face is actually a formation made by aliens, as a way to keep their audiences interested and to make more incom by their audiences believing their predictions of aliens.

As a result of the majority of people believing that the Face was an alien artifact, NASA decided to fly over the formation again to take a new picture using an updated camera that was ten times sharper than the camera used originally to take the first pictures, in order to investigate if he formation was really made and occupied by an alien life form. The new pictures concluded that

what seemed to be an alien life form was actually just an actual landform. Yes, there may be different and unusual kinds of makrings on the land form because it is located on a different planet where there are different conditions occurring.

What has now been proven to show that the Face is a natual landform is that the landform is the Martian equivalent of a buttle, which are landforms common around the American West.

Whether you believe or don't believe that the landform on the Red Planet is made by aliens, there is more authentic evidence that is relevent to showing that the landform is just a natural occurrence, rather than evidence presented by science fiction enthusiasts. Although the formation may seem to have the appearance of a face, there are also many natural objects on Earth that have the appearances of faces too. So, making assumptions because of a conspiracist's predictions does not automatically make your assumption correct.   ",4
0502b23,"Technology in the classroom has always been a great idea, it allows for students to find information quicker, keep all their assignments in one place. But now it could be used to interpret the emotions of students. This technology could be used to detect how students are feeling about a teachers teaching style; this software could also detect if a student is bored or confused, and even if they are sad or angry.

Using this technology can help determine what is neccesary in keeping a classroom engaged and happy. But students may not want a machine reading their emotions at all times in a classroom, say that a student has lost a loved one and doesn't want that to be public to the faculty at the school because he might be treated diffrent. The technology could detect his sadness and the teacher may try to comfort him, or tell other teachers about the way he feels. But for the greater good of possibly detecting depressed or suicidal students may out weigh the bad that the technology may produce. I am for this type of technology in the classroom, its benifits out weigh its fallbacks, other than possibly being inaccurate due to displaying false emotions.

The use of emotional recognition software in the classroom is a great idea to keep students in the minds of their teachers and truely help them create an environment that is catered to the happiness of their students. Lets not forget how useful it will be to detect if students are actually learning in the classroom. And probaly most importantly to detect students who may be a threat to themselves or others.",3
0509d92,"In addition to, the story people think that the Face was created by aliens. In this essay i will be talking about, Whether or not people have proof or evidence that the Face was created by aliens?, What would make people think that the Face was created by aliens?, and How do you think this if you just found out about the Face?.

With that being said, Do you think these people that thought the Face was created by aliens have proof or any type of evidence?... I don't think they had proof or any type of evidence because it was on Mars people csn not go around assuming that it was created by aliens if they have no proof. People would have to go to Mars and see for theirselves. Just because it was founded on Mars doesn't neccesarly means that it was created by aliens.

Next, What makes people think that the Face was created by aliens?. Is it because they knew that it came from Mars?... I strongly believe it is because all these people knew that it came from Mars, i'll tell you why i think this. I think this because it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stores as stated in paragraph 5. So, because it appeared in so many places people started to make assumtions, and really believed that the Face was created and made by aliens.

Futhermore, How does people think this if they just recently found out about the Face?. Well, people think this just because it it was the most popular story or myth going on at the time and since it came from Mars that it was created by aliens because they know people doesn't live on Mars.. But, that doesn't mean human beings do not visit to see what it is like in person.

In my opinion, last but not least, people should not make any assumtions before they don't know the full story or the truth behind it all and to ask people who was it created it by and stop always thinking they know everything and making a lot of assuming statements, to where it makes a huge rumor around the world.",4
051429c,"In the Article ""The challengle of Exploring Venus""

the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" (para 3.)

The article states, "" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" (para 2) I think the author means by that is humans can not really study Venus's because its in space and no human can go up there too long and study it since its the secong planet next to the sun.

The planet is dangerous because its right by the sun which if you go by the sun you can burn and die from it. The planet's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

It also has 97 percent carbon dioxide which means the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

In conclusion, I think the author is right. Venus is dangerous and i think NASA should not study it.       ",3
0514ba2,"Is the Electoral College fair and right? This system is composed of the selection of the electors, the meeting of electors, and the counting of congress. This systen includes various methods like the ""winner take all"" system that gives the presidency to the winning candinate of the eletors votes. One very important thing in this system is trust, you have to trust the electors that you voted for to make the right choice. This system of eletor votes is very useful for picking the country's leaders.

The winner take all method is very intresting indeed. The electoral votes decide who wil get what, who will win. Popular vote in no longer in ""session"" or popular, the electoral votes decide it now. For example, in the 2000 election, when Gore had a lot more popular votes than Bush, but Gore had less electoral votes, it was a shocking suprise for the nation, it seemed to be like more people liked Gore than Bush. One very important thing to consider is ... the reason why Bush won, there is a huge diffrence between making a good choice, aka Gore, and and making the right choice, aka Bush!

Trust, its possibliy one of the most hard things to do in life, but in this system its necessary. Its very significant that you put your trust in the slate of people's hands that you and a whole variety of woried people selected. Trust should not just be handed oveer like anything, its should be earned just like respect, vote in the candinate that you trust.

Popular vote is kind of fair in a way because we can all vote like independent citizens.

Sometimes the electoral candinates vote against the people that elected for them and go for what they think is right which in no case is incorrect but a hudreds of citizens were counting on them to make their choice. We all have a voice, we have to use it in the fair way, and the righthous way is mostly a popular vote, but popular vote is not as efficent as eletoral votes.

The Electoral College is right but not fair, althought it has its benifets, its has its defaults as well. In the end we all decide our own fate, but together we must work together to rebuild what has been broken. We must decide on the correct, on the right leader, the leader that will make great choices for us, the leader that will lead this unique, beautiful, and magnificent country to greatness like never befroe seen, and we must be there with that leader every step of the way. Not everyone will expericence greatness but we sure will be part of it!!    ",3

05182bf,"Unmasking the Face on Mars. If I were to be a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks the face was created by aliens. I would prove them wrong, because there are many objects that have some sort of illusion in them. This story tells how the Face is just a simple landform which I believe it is. It's a natural landform because when astronauts were circling around the planet they found it to be a simple landform. Seeing new things that look just like human things can just be an illusion to our eyes, for example the red planet could have had the ""Face"" carved into it.

I think that there are objects that can always fool our minds especially planets. There are certain planets that give us many illusions and we just want to go and figure out why they make us have such an illusion towards nonimportant things. The image of the Face that was spotted in Mars first appeared on a JPL web site, which means that the image was first taken by NASA. I believe that aliens do not exsist still and there could have been no way that the Face was created by one of them. Neil Armstrong was the first astronaut to ever be on the moon and when he came back from the moon he left his steps on the moon. The Face could have been created by someone who has visited Mars (Red Planet) even though the planet almost is the same temperature as the sun they could have taken a pocket knife and began to crave in a human face.

The Face was spotted on Mars, but the certain place that it was spotted was a lava dome, what is a lava dome you may ask?. Well, a lava dome is a place that is isolated from a mesa and can be up the same height as the Face on Mars. There are still some scientist that believe that the Face was someting that aliens created when it could've been a person or even people that wanted to leave a trace left behind. Maybe they left a trace left behind because there probably wasn't anybody who has been there before.

The Face was spotted by NASA and when NASA spotted the face they made sure to zoom in on what looked like Face. I believe that the Face was carved or traced behind due to a human being there, even though they say aliens live in Mars there could be no way that a alien did a cetain thing. Aliens could not have been the ones who left the illusion of a Face because some studies show that aliens were not exsisting at that time. The story also does not state anything towards aliens being on a certain planet especially Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that things you leave on a planet can not always be something a alien did or has done. Our mind has such a great technique to play with our minds, especially if we see things from above like the Face was seen from above. I do believe the Face was just a natural landform. I believe it was just a natural landform because there are some things on planets that have such and illusion into them.",4
0519419,"Dear Mr.Senetor,

My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn't because it's not fair for everyone. That is why i believe the Electoral Collge system should be no more.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" It's not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn't fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opporitunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don't give them a chance.

""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states...Voters in the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing they are going to decide the election."" Yes, the toss-up states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the ""swing"" states. They are just as good as the people who want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because he lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!

So in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn't only get to be the electors decision on who gets to be President, but it also shouldn't be based off the more known states. Give other states, ""swing"" states, a chance too. That is why i say the electoral system should be no more.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME                                                                                           ",4
051c46a,"Dear senator,

I have done research and I would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States. Source 1: ""What is electoral College?"" explains that ""each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" Many people do not know what that really means. It means that the people of the United States do not actually vote for who their president will be. They are voting for someone who gets to choose who the president will be. Having the Electoral College is very confusing. I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of electios that then choose the president.

By getting rid of the Electoral College, the vote for the United States president will be more fair. We, the people of the United States, would not be voting for a slate of electors. We would actually be voting for who we want to become our president. These votes would be more direct and accurate.

Source 2: ""Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states that voters may get confused and vote for someone that they didnt want to vote for. The people should be the ones voting for their president. It is unfair that only the electors get to vote in the end. Voters of the electors cannot even control who the electors vote for. The people have to put their trust in the electors to vote for the president. It make smore sense for the people to have a say and for them to have the ability to vote directly.

When I turn eighteen and I am allowed to vote, I hope that my vote actually matters. I hope that my vote does not just go towards an elector. I hope that my vote will count towards whom I think will represent our country well.            ",3

Cities like Bejing, in China, are heavily polluted by emissions from motor vehicles.  This has negative effects on people's health and the environment.  Another point to be made is that if fewer people are driving cars then you won't have to see cars parked all over your city.  But this is America, not Europe; we like our cars here.  I couldn't stand not being able to drive my Ford Mustang GT whenever i feel like it. That is the problem, people will not want to give up driving their cars.

Simlar structures are on the Earth called mesa and butte usually are seen in the American.

0540b80,"I am personally against the idea of self driving cars. Why you may be asking yourself, am I against an idea that could possibly be revolutionary? Well that's because of how dangerous and irresponsible the whole idea sounds like. We already have enough accidents as it is. Why add more chaos by throwing in cars that can drive themselves? The idea itself is very unrealistic and is just awaiting to be produced to cause trouble.

Firstly, why are we so dependent on technology? Why is it that we create so many inventions to make regular things even better? We should simply be improving where we are going wrong, not distracting ourselves with new toys that have just came out ; figuritevly speaking of course. We rely on electronics so much that most people woudln't be able to function without having a cell phone or a game system.

Now don't get me wrong, some electronics have truly changed the game for us. We can fit loads of data and information on a single piece of metal. We can talk to people across the world, and travel is as good as that as well. Though most of these inventions depend on a human to operate them. Must we create something that doesn't have a rational mindset? Computers don't have emotions the last time I remembered.

The idea is also extremely unsafe. I already mentioned car accidents that may possibly happen, which they will. Though responsible adults are not the only people who drive on roads too. Teenagers who are learning to drive won't even need to know the basics of the road thanks to these self driving monsters! Teens are the most likely to get into car accidnets than any other age group. Just the thought of a young 15 year old on the road, not knowing how to drive an actual car sounds morbid.

The point that I am trying to get across is not only are these cars: unrealistic, unsafe, dangerous, and accident prone; but that they will be the descendent of humanity. Think about it, whenever you drive in a car with friends, family, or just

people in general; people are bonding, communicating, listening to music, or just looking out the window. With phones being extremely popular nowadays, we are slowly losing ourselves with the increase of these productions. Now with these cars, they will change everything. It's a downward fall from that, which is mainly why I am against the whole development of these machines.",4

0545b94,"This Facial Action Coding System is weird. Why would anyone want to know what someone else is feeling or how their emotions are? To me that is personal information that I would want to myself. Plus I doubt that there would be a whoe lot a people who would put money into this to just see what emotion they are. That is just me though. What do you think about this idea? Would you spend time and money on it to just see your emotions and what mood you were in? I wouldn't.

If you keep reading from now on I am going to argue why this is a bad idea, because it is. I mean who would spend any type of time, effort, or money on this just to see what your emotions are or how you are feeling. Honestly who wants to know what facial expressions to use to show that you are happy, I think we already know how to be happy. We dont need a machine to tell us how to look happy. Obviously when someone is happy something great has happened to them or in their lives and they have a great big smile on their face. We also know when someone is mad, obviously when someone is mad they don't like to talk very much, and usually look like they are about to punch you in the face. For example in the text it shows you step by step what expression on your face we need to use to make us look happy, like no I know how to look happy or sad or mad, I don't need a machine to tell me how to do that.

So why do we need a machine to tell us these things when we already know them. Our world is just spending money on useless things and inventing usless things that our world today doesn't need. There is literally no point to the invention. Plus I don't think strangers would want us to calculate their emotions and how they are feeling right now. I mean those things are personal we don't know what their life is like or what they have been through.

To me this is what I am thinking. Is this really what they are spending our money on. The taxes we pay and all the bills we have to pay and they are speding it on these types of silly, usless inventions. Why? Just think, out of the whole world how many of us are going to use this? How many of us have the money to use it? How many of us would think its a great idea? Probably very, very, very few of us in the whole world would use this invention.

That is my take on this Facial Action Coding System. I dont like the idea of it. I think it it useless and would very seldom be used. What do you think? Do you agree with me, or not with me? Would you use it? Would you spend the money on it? Would you want someone to know how you are feeling and the emotions you are going through?",3

When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, it snapped a photo, much clearer than the one obtained by the Viking. When the photo surfaced online, it proved to be nothing but a natural landform. However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy.

It is a process the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified cirizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors. Most states use a ''winner-take-all'' method that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Electoral College is the method we use for voting and selecting our president's.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Therefore I think that we should change to a popular vote. Over 50 percent of the people agreee, and I think that should be enough proof. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

The problem with the electoral college is that you voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, wwho in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate. The slate containing 34 Democratic electors pleged to Kerry. Most likely those voters would probably win the election because Texas is a big state and a high percentage of the people voted Kerry.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Just as Romney was a solid regional in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states. This causes the method to be difficult to chose a for sure winner. Usually elections are always close.

The Electoral College restores some of that weight in the pollitical balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The method may turn off potential voters. Especially for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California. I think that we should changeb to a popular vote method. Either way, people should be encouraged to vote because every vote counts.    ",3
05580e1,"There are many questions about the mystery of the ""Face on Mars."" The article states that the picture of the Face is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" More information about the ""Face on Mars"" is in the following statements.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence. ",3
05592d5,"People over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because of the phrase"" Cars that drive themselves"". Yes it sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides to this idea and there are some good sides. It depends on the people that you ask because some could say oh no way! Then there are some that could say oh yes way! Then you have to think of it this way, are these futuristic cars even safe for humans to be in?

Driverless cars do sound really cool to me because then you don't really need to do anything but sit back and watch. Then again I just don't think that I would want a car that drives itself only because of the dangers it kind of puts you in. For example, in the passage it states that these cars have all of these sensors on it that can keep you safe while you're driving it, well what do you do if while that car is driving and one of the sensors malfunctions and there is a car running a stop sign while it's your turn to go what do you do? You won't even see the car coming from the side of you and that sensor malfunctioned so it can't alert the car then you get smacked into by the other vehicle. These cars do come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen at any given moment. So yes these cars are cool but I would never get one for myself.

In paragraph two when it talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves, I think it can be a bad thing for them doing that. That's because the way movies and TV portray the driverless cars is so unreal but others who don't understand that well, they could be in a good amount of danger. For example in the movie Transformers, every single one of those cars drive themselves. They steer themselves, they can open their own doors, they can do all of this stuff and someone who actually believes that that is what these manufacturers are coming out with, then they are wrong because they think that it will be able to do that stuff and while they're distracted BOOM! They just got t- boned by another driver because the person wasn't paying attention. These cars could really cause a lot of danger to society.

Driverless cars are way too dangerous to me, I feel like people would be irrisponsible with them and cause harm to the community. I'm against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can proove to me that these cars are 100% safe. Like we all know today there are crazy drivers out thtere and with them on the road with a car like this, that could put a ton of people in danger. To help prove my whole point in paragraph 9 it says that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer""? Well here is the thing, it said if the technology fails. That means that there is a chance of the technology failing and causing harm, just like a lot of other technology can do. For example, some sort of saw to cut wood or metal. If one of those things malfunctions and a blade goes flying it could hit someone and easily kill them. Not all technology is 100% fool proof so that is why I wouldn't trust this driverless car.

So once again I do not support the creation of one of these driverless vehicles because of a safety issue. Even if this car does have all of these sensors on it that doesn't mean that it is totally safe because you still have all of these other crazy drivers on the road that could potentially smack into if they aren't paying attention or even if you aren't paying attention. Yes in the movies these cars do look really cool but I don't think that they need to be created and brought into real life. I say that we just stick to what we already do. That's having actual people drive the car instead of having a computer programmed into the car driving it. Now I know people don't drive 100% either but what if the technology fails and someone dies in a crash? Then what do you do? You definitely can't blame the person for something that a company made malfunctioning. We the people just need to stop and think about what all could happen if you let a computer drive your two to three ton vehicle.                          ",5
056394c,"What is your opinion on smart cars? Would they help or just create future issues that were worse than before? I personaly support the current movement on smart cars. If the technology improves enough to cover all the current issues then I believe smart cars could really help alot. They would decrease accidents and allow people to use valuable time driving to do other things like learn or invent. Im standing in neutral ground though on weather they should be completely driverless unless they improve the smart cars in a way to make them completely safe.

To fully support smart cars and turn the publics opinion on supporting them I belive they need to create new laws that would clearly state whos resbonsible if an accident does accur. I think this because who would want to buy a car that you dont have to drive, but if the car does get into an accident your resbonsible! That would be a big problem and would creat problems between individuals and car manufacturers. The question being whos resbonsible?

Another thing they would have to improve would be their sensing technology. They would have to improve this because currently if their is an accident or detour they driver has to take over. If they want to make driverless cars then they should be driverless at all times. Would you agree? If the driver is being entertained and watching movies then suddenly after hours of watching movies he has to be completely focuse and in control of the vehicle wouldnt the person be a little tired and not completely focused? Im not totaly for sure how they could fix this problem, but im sure it will raise questions in the near future. Seeing how they want to push the people into supporting smart cars they would have to fix all issues and cover all the corners.

All of these small improvement would, in my opinion, turn the publics eyes into supporting smart cars. Getting the public to support smart cars would be one of the most important things to do if they want smart cars to be a success. If nobody supports them then all the work they are doing would be useless. Support would also put thme in a better financial spot. Having more money to put into smart cars would mean better and more improved research and development.

If all of the issues I brought up could be worked on and improved then, in my opinion, their would be no reasoning for people and myself for not supporting smart cars. Hopefully i'v coverd some of the current issues with smart cars and once their improved you will be like me and support the ever so growing idea of smart driverless vehicles.This is my opinion on smart cars. As long as they can continue to improve and come out with new ideas I fully support the movement on smart driverless automobiles!",4
056a4a4,"Everyone today believes that having a car is the best thing for them. Truthfully, it is not. Not having a car can prevent from polluting the earth and benifit us as people in a much better way. Not having a car will stop accidents, prevent deaths, and save you money.

In Vauban, many families now do not own cars. Heidrum Walter states ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car could actually make you a much happier person as well. You would'nt have to worry about spending too much money on gas or even getting into accidents. If you have to go somewhere far, you can just hop on a subway or pay for a taxi. I know, your probaly thinking: Paying for a taxi or paying for a subway ticket cost money but definately not nearly as much as having a car.

Next, without having to drive cars, our air we breath in will be much less polluted then it would be with cars. Paris evenually ended up on banning driving because the smog was so harsh to the environment. Anyone who drove cars were then fined. According to the article

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Congestion is car traffic so therefore, there was less smog in the air. In the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota , it states ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" Anyone who violated the rule was then fined a specific amount to stop the people from driving cars. Businessesman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air polution.""

Not owning a car can help you and your family become closer because you will have to walk places together, it will help you stay fit and it will benifit the companies because they will start to boom. In  source 4, Michael Sivak says ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" This means that more families are getting rid of their cars then they ever have before which will make the families closer. Walking everywhere will help you stay fit because your walking not sitting. Last but not least, companies will begin to boom. Source 3 states that ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks: rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic: and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" They are trying everything they can to make this world a better place. They are redoing a bunch of stuff just to show that they care. So lets show them that we care about our world too.

So lets think about the benifits of not having a car. You will be less stressed, you'll be in less accidents and you will save money. If I could have that decision I totally would take it. It is benifical for all of us so lets just live life healthy.                                          ",4

One nation under god"", they say, so why do we still have other people determine our nations future? we should be able to have say over our country, atleast when it comes to picking the president. Yeah, We vote for the Electorals that are going to vote for our president, but how do we really know if they are. There are alot of schemes now a days regarding the government, our Electorals can just get paid off to promote one president but then vote for another.

On source 2 "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford plumer says"" Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.""  I mean not only is the Electoral college unreliable but it is also confusing to some. At the end of the day even if we have some say in picking our president if he doesn't have enough electoral votes, he is still going to lose. It doesn't even matter if we vote anymore. On source 2 ""what's wrong with the electoral college?""  Bradford explains "" in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the demcratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kenneddy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" This, is what I mean by unreliable, we can't trust our Electorals, we should be able to vote directly! who we want as our president and not some shady second party.

Another thing i would like to address in source 3 ""Big States"" Richard says "" A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state doess..."" Exactly, if we do popular votes, candidates can just go to states and try to win them over as oppossed to Electorals taking claim of one state . Also if we approve popular votes, that one smalll state , could just make a difference on who wins so in other words, every state counts and every vote counts.                                             ",3
0571af0,"The world is advancing, technologies are being built, and the enviroment is changing. Imagine living in an area where there's a limited car usage. It might sound horrible but life goes on without cars. As to limiting your car usage it also has it's advantages. The advantages goes towards the people and the enviroment.

To start, everyone would know that the main reason is because of the state of our enviroment. There's a lot of pollution going out there in the world and it's not safe or natural. To give an example, according to the article, written by Elisabth Rosenthal, ""In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", passenger cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas and fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. To exemplify, greenhouse gases is one of the causes for the changes around the environment. They're not the good changes either. To support this, the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", written by Robert Duffer, shows an example of Paris and China banning car usages due to their high pollution and smogs. Robert Duffer states, ""Congestion was down sixty perent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In other words, polllution can hold a great affect of people trying to go to work, have fun, or even visit someone. Not only is change in the enviroment is bad but some people can just live without the use of transportation.

The continue to the advantages, the people get to spend their time with others more and even be happy just walking around. Going back to the article ""In German Suburb, life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer,  Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" To extend this, having a car would cause some people to be tense and stressed. Without the ability to do anything about it but just sit there or walk, it is much better to walk around with the people who's close. Another example would from the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selksy, another commentary made from a businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees with it. Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In other words, not only is the car-free day works for helping improve the enviroment, it's good for releasing stress for few people.

To conclude, letting go of driving around may sound like a disadvantage but it's actually an advantage to those around us. It's an advantage for both the enviroment and us. Who wouldn't want a stress-free enviroment?            ",4
05806ed,"Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was looking for somwhere to land on Mars for Viking 2 when it sppoted a showdow that looked like a face. The enoemous head was nearly two miles from end to end. The facewas just a natural landform.

Only few scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact. But the article states that when NASA unvieled the image for all to see, the caption that went with it noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembled a human head... formed by shadows giving an illution of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also in the article it says the author even reasoned ""it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars"".

The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon.

On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument.

Of course not everyone was happy. It's much cooler to have it be a alien artifact than a natural landform. People weren't giving up. The face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bored of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the alein markings were hidden by haze.

Mission controlers prepared to look again. The article states that ""we just don't pass over the face very often"".

On April 8, 2001, it was acloundless summer day; the Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you could easily see if there were shacks or small airplanes.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. These are landforms common around the American West.

This all proves that the so called ""Face on mars"" was just a landform and not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the landforms made it appear to look like a face but it was just a cauincedince. ",3

The ¨Face¨ on Mars is not an actually face at all. If there were life on Mars, this life definitally wouldn´t be enormous as it say in the artical ¨Unmasking the Face on Mars¨ in paragraph one. It states, ¨An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.¨. Another reason why the face isn´t life on mars it that in paragraph twelve Gravin talks about how this face remind him of similar landforms back on Earth. Garvin also says how there are common landforms around the American West, so if there was life on Mars why would there be simlar landmarks on Earth? The staement Garvin say is that ¨It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,¨ Garvin also mentions that the landform in Idaho is the a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same size as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, The Face on Mars isn´t any type of life or aliens because there are similar landforms in the American West of the U.S. like the lava dome in Idaho that Garvin says is similar in size and it looks the same. Another quote in this article is ¨An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be looking at back at the cameras.¨ now if there was to be life on Mars, the life would not be enormous I can tell you that.

058ecd3,"Limiting car usage isnt such a bad idea. For starters, it helps keep a friendly enviroment, it also saves money and time for people to get to know eachother and talk a little more.

To begin with, limiting car usage would help keep a healthy, clean enviroment. In the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars' Elisabeth Rosenthal states that ""the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communtities, and legislatures are starting to act, if cautiously."" Which shows that less car usage would help protect our enviroment. Not only the enviromental agency, but the government and people agree. Also in the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert states that ""the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruling French part to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" giving us the fact that th esmog from the cars was hurting the eviroment and causing smog and reckless driving.

Secondly, limiting car usage would would save money and gas. In the article, 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert Duffer says that ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined-diesles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" We all know diesles an expensive gas, that more than half of France has to pay for just to get from place to place. It also proves that reckless driving and smog from cars can cause damage to someones pockets with fines.

Lastly, reduced driving can help people within the same community, get to know eachother better because your either riding around on a bike or walking, giving you the chance to associate with your neighborhood friends. As stated in the article 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' , ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resteraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" which shows that driving had good aspects and helped the communty get along more.

In conclusion, thats why limiting car usage would have a good affect on our communities and a good affect on th ewhole world in general, because it helps keep a friendly enviroment, and it saves money and time for family and friends.    ",3

059af98,"Scientists are striving to meet the challenge of exploring the dangerous planet of Venus. Scientist believe that long ago Venus may have supported various forms of life. Looking up at Venus from Earth is a safe distance to visualize the planet since it is very challenging to examine it more closely. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. These dangers include the enviroment, but it is worthy pursuit becuase it part of human curiosity, and innovation.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth. This pressure can crush a submarine. The temperature can liquefy many metals. Venus has eurpting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Venus is now an inhospital to any form of life.

Human curiosity drives scientist eagerly to explore this planet despite of the many danger is upholds. Many scientist believe that Venus could have a been able to support life long time ago. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus.

NASA is trying to still pursuit solutions to these challenges so that human might actually have a chance to explore this dangerous but amazing planet.

05aacdb,"The advantages of limiting car usage has errupted since the year 2005. America's love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car; they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday; maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air polution will decrese or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota's day without cars and Paris's driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.

As a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany's people has said a life without cars is wonderfull even if it takes a little more time to get places. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""(Rosenthal.3). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal's statistic Vauban's citizens are happy in this new way of life; they have learned that a life without cars can be different' but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.""Vauban's streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community""(Rosenthal.2). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal Vauban's streets being car free is a easier life; there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer.10). Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. ""On monday many motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day""(Duffer.11). Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.

As a result, to America's campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.    ",4

As it was stated canidates never spend time with other states and they feel their votes dont really count during the election. I think it would be better if the canidates would vist every state and talk to them about what changes would be made if theyre the president.

The state legislatures are more responsible than us as voters so probably our vote doesnt really matter. Also the elctoral college truly dont pay attention to the problems about the votes and states that dont have a spark of hope that arent effected by the election but in elections it gives the chance as voters to express that political knowledge and background who would be best as our president.

Other than that the other side of the argument is reasonable too. Theyre good outcomes to it like the voter most of them upstate really pay close attention to the election they take all this information on each canidates to know who to vote and they are the most thoughtful during it.

People love cars but also love money some love money more than cars people could save a lot of money on gas if they didn't have a car or cut low on they're mileage and use another type of transportation.""when I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way"" said heidrun walter a media trainer and mother of two. in the united states, the environmental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. If more people tried the ""car reduced"" program the air we breathe would be much better then it is right now.

More places are trying to reduce car rates which I highly doubt but it never hurts to try. Even paris bans driving; paris bans driving because they want to cleant the air of the global city. ""even-numbered license plates were ordered to leace their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"".  Also Diesel fuel was blamed for the smog in France because 67% of the vehicles in France is made for Diesel. The smog cleared enough on monday but there's no saying that the smog is not going to come back... the plan to ban even and odd numbers plate licenses was a great idea for people of French they should do that every couple months so they could avoid the Smog. In Bogota, Colombia people are also having car-free day which is outstading for the community and for the the people in Bogota, Colombia.""it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day wtihout cars in this capital city of 7 million"". the goal of banning cars is to promote alternative transportation and redcue smog. the more we use alternative transportation is more money the goverment and the people that doing they're jobs as alternate drivers.""It's a good oppurtinity totake away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Also the event was doing so well that two other Colombian cities joined such as Cali, and Valledupar.

""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years befoe the downturn"" said Micheal sivak who studied the trend and who is aresearc proffesor at the university of Michigan's transportation research Institute. the downturn must be now because as I see now almost everybody has a car these days old cars,recent cars, brand new cars, and all types of cars. "" i think that means something more fundamental is going on"". if the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implicants for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second lagest source of America's emissions. Also more car companies are trying to make cars that are eco friendly like hybrid,Tesla, and the volt. the volt is an electric car that does not any gas run.               ",2
05b01a4,"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star"", is the closest thing to Earth as far as the base planets go. It is often called Earth's twin, even if it doesn't seem that way. The surface temperature is nearly 800 degrees Fahrenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth. This being said, scientists are still fascinated by Venus, as it could have been just like Earth long ago. Despite the dangers it presents, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because it could lead to many scientific discoveries, and set foot on another planet and gather data, and see what happened to Venus and possibly find out how to prevent it from happening to Earth.

Even getting to Venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. Furthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. A vehicle hovering Venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions. Even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working everyday to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. For example, NASA has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus-like conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. Another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. They could be made to withstand the conditions of Venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study.

Although there are many challenges that need to be overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to Venus, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the discoveries it could hold. From regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface. ",3
05b0858,"Venus is the second plannet closest planet closest to the sun and has the tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because of the challanges and resources that may occur. NASA has shown from this study that nobody has touched this planet because of their preventions.

Venus is a worthy pursuit of studying despite the danger it presents from the challenges that occur. From knowing the risks of people not surviving to be able to stay on a planet for more than a few hours, it makes it more of a challenge to at least touch venus. Although the text states, ""NASA’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This shows that this is the safest spot to be close enought to venus. The text also states, ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" From the text, it has shown that nobody has the problem of going to venus for a study, just as the problem of coming back survived and healthy. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by seeing what people are capable of managing to do.

From studying Venus that can pursuit many resouces that are and could be presented in this project. NASA sees this as a processing challenge by having resources that could be processed. For an example, the text states ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."". By having a device that could help the danger and requirements, could solve the solution of the pressure in the atmosphere. If NASA is able to get to the planet, there will be many sources to be brought back for examination to study. For an example,""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."", the text has shown their are many types of feauture to be explored. The text also states,""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."", from this iy shows that if the resoucres come reasonable to use, it could increase the possibility.

From the study of venus it has shown knowing how it can increase the production of each challenge and resouce. It is possible to be completed with correct amount of studying . Studying impacts on how much you know of the project to process through all of the steps. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts by the challenges and resources being presented.",4
05b31a1,"Venus is rather uninhabitable, or is it?

Although dangerous, one would not say uninhabitable, as that implies it is impossible. the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Discusses how it is perfectly plausible, and even worth it! That is, only if we have the correct equipment to do so.

Now while there are dangers, such as sulfiric acid clouds, metal melting heat, earthquakes, lightning strikes, volcanoes, and the mechanism shattering atmospheric pressure (Paragraph 3), you may ask ""Why go through the trouble if the conditions are so horrible?"". The reason is that it was so much like earth long ago, oceans and rock formations, even theoretical life!

NASA is helping with this idea via brainstorming for ideas to study venus, the first is to hover above it, avoiding all the surface problems, and still being close. The only issue, as provided by the author, wouldnt work, because while they would be in the air, the clouds would be too thick to allow anything, thus rendering the idea useless.

Another NASA idea is to use different electronics, like simpler models, and having them TAILORED for venus, such models lasted up to 3 weeks even! If those do not work, instead of moving foreward in our electronics, NASA would move back, back to the 1940s with mechanical computers, levers and gears computing what a normal computer could quicker and better, but while the mechanical option is slower, it is MUCH more durable.

With all of these ideas, I feel the author did an outstanding job supports this idea, and I support it whole-heartedly, it may be possible in the coming years, as our technology rapidly evolves, so do we, what do you think?",3
05b37db,"It was either I'm against or for the value of using technology to read students emotions. I happen to be against it, because yo uuse technology for working not reading emotions first of all. Two, we aren't lab rats.

I think that if you want to find out your emotions, you're pretty weird from my point of view. You should know how you feel, not letting a computer or any other technology ran device to find out your emotions. If you don't know your emotions that's because you have mixed thoughts. Your facial expression that you show to people as you walk around should tell them how you feel, for instance; looking upset shows many emotions, smiling could mean you're happy or just faking it because you're actually really depressed and don't want anyone to know. This technology that people are creating just to do that is a waste of time. Do something different, don't focus on something that people may not really even use. There are more reasons on way I am against it because all it did was just show a painting's emotions.

Therefore, that is why i am against this facial Action Coding Device. It makes no sense to me at all on why anybody would want to create this type of technology. ",2
05bcd1b,"th author supports this idea by giving me information on how close venus is and how the dangers on the planet is. the author also goives me the conditions on venus. the author also lets me know the terrain on venus and how its our nearest option for a planetary visit.

Venus is also known as the eaving star even tho that description is miss leading to scientists. the evidence i have is that venus is not habitable at all. venus is not habitable for many reasons. Venus is a very dangerous planet for us humans. Venus has a high level of carbon dioxide. Venus atmosphere is just a thick layer of carbon dioxide wich makes it hard

for humans to actully get through. As an example, every space craft thats been hasnt survived as long as just a couple hours. the pressure is also 90x srtonger than what we experience here on earth.

The only safe way to actully see and study venus is to hover over the planet just to keep scientists safe. Venus's is so much of a dangerous planet, scientists arent even able to get samples or rocks or gas.",2

What if something goes wrong with the driverless car or what if the car doesn;t go the way that you want it to go or what if you crash? Do you just blame it on the car like its the cars problem or is it the persons problem? What if it your car gets damaged badly can they fix the driverless car and will they have parts for it?

I also idea because what if you have to call someone or text someone and its something important. I think they're also good for navigation. You could just tell the car where you want to go and it will take you there. It could probably cause less accidents because its ran by a computer and usually the people fault foir the accidents but what if the computer just stops working? Does that mean that the car just stops working?

Before they realise the car I think that they should have better technology first. The technology now is amazing but I don't think a computer can be smart enough to drive a car just yet.

05c4acd,"A person who thinks that the Face on Mars is a alien is not right because I the scientist knows that it's not aliens because we have research on it. Even though it may look like an ailen it's not, it is just a natural landform.

In papragraph seven it states on April 5 1998 that the scientist took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Alo it revealed on a JPL web site that it was just a natural landform. Also that there was no alien monument after all.

If the person who still thinks it was created by aliens is stupid because NASA has proof the it is a natural monument. I would show them the photos and have proof that it was. Anyways they would be able to see it way better in the picture and see that i was right.

In paragraph 12 it says that the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ""The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, a face created by aliens and put on Mars is unrealistic. It had to be God or just a natural lanfrom. NASA has proved it in 2001. They also have pictures of the landform. Therefroe it was not aliens.

When we noticed it eas just a mesa in the face. When some people herad about it they thoght it was aliens who made that. We then told them that it was just a mesa that when the shadows hit it it made it look like a face. And that nasa's budget wish there was an ancient civleization on mars.

05c94e5,"Studying Venus

Planets are a very interesting, Earth, Mars , Venus, and others are all planets in the solar system. Venus is an interesting one, and one that not much is known about. This is why Venus must be explored and have discoveries made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why that is. The planet Venus would save time while visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made.

Venus is worth being studied because it is one of the closer planets to Earth. It is a planetary neighbor to earth. In the article ,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states,"" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Par. 4).Because Venus is a closer planet to Earth time could be saved and there would not be a worry about time being lost as if traveling to a different planet.

Secondly, Venus has similarties to Earth, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Par. 4). Just like on Earth Venus also includes the same quality land features. Going to Venus and discovering the way the land features form would be a magnificent thing to discover and being able to see how the earthquakes and natural disasters appeasr.

Lastly, while exploring Venus, reasoning for the temperatures and dangers of Venus could possibly be prevented. If someone was to discover how to prevent the dangerous factors then maybe there would not be a problem to land on Venus. Making that discovery is important and would help scientists learn more about Venus. The article states,"" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth""(Par. 3). Taking time to discover Venus could be a great thing.

Although Venus is a dangerous Planet with crucial temperatures, exploring the planet could be very beneficial to scientists and multiple discoveries could be made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why it is. The planet Venus would save time when visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made. Contributing to the study of Venus may be challenging, but in the end would be quite beneficial and would make a difference. ",3
05cafcf,"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in schools is a great idea.

Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.

If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.

This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.

If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.

If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.

The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.

Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.

I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.

Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.

Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.

This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions everyday.

I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be exremely helpful.

The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emtions which is helpful because most people have trouble percieving facial traits and expressions.

If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

I think that you should participate because you get to go on a cruise like Luke did and the story of A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves story. Also you get to have fun and If you have not been on a cruise before you get to try to have fun why you are doing your work like going to check on the animals but be careful. If you like to be a cowboy and a cowgirl you can participate in the program if you like cruise's and animals. You can always can help out the animals and the people if you see them and you trouble like trying to get there animals to eat and you see them going crazy you can help out. Luke's claims from the article that he try's to like help out the animals by going to check on the animals ever each time to get his work done on time. He one time failed down the stairs to check on the animals but he couldn't work becaues his rib was broken but he was doing fine. Luke was always do his work but he do a good job to finish his job on the cruise. Luke claims was okay because he try to get done so he can check on the animals because he don't wont to get fired from the Cowboy Waves program because he like working as a cowboy he might be a cowboy that's might be why he work there because he can talk to his friend's and he might give people visit's on the cruise to see the animals to get food and to see the animals to. Luke might show you the place if you participate and the program i will to because it sound fun to be and the program.

05d73d1,"Driverless cars would be very effeiciant. There are many pros to having them and it would be very beneficial for many reasons.

Like Sergey Brin said, these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. Since we're already started to run out on this fuel, having these types of cars would benefit us very greatly. If self driving cars could get better alerts for when the driver needs to do something, it would be easier for people to multi task as well. Self driving cars would also be better, because less crashes would happen. From the text, sensors can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response than a human driver could manage. More improvememnts could make driving much more safer.

Although the self drivng cars are not completly driverless now, it would be very possible to do so with funding. If it were possible to make a car completely driverless, there would not be so much doubt about them. There would also be much more safety. Self driving cars would be very reliable. If it is possible to have them by 2020, a lot could change about transportation.

I think this is unnessesary because the future generation isn't going to learn how to drive an actual real car. Cars that humans can actually drive.

In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Flordia, and even the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Yeah, it's okay to have driverless cars around, but only for certain emergencies. Driverless cars can even take over people's jobs! And what are those people going to do without a job?

If the technology fails and someone is injured, who's at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Probably the driver because he or she didn't took over when the emergency was occuring. And what if that certain person didn't have a license? Even though traffic laws change we are still not garunteed that we will be safe inside a driverless car. New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.

In conclusion, we are still going to be in risk. I still think it's a ridiculous idea. I predict that they are going to be more accidents than they are in regular cars. The road to autonomous cars stretches on over the years. We are growing closer and closer to the destination every day. Do you think driverless cars will take over? ",3
05efbec,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author, Nick D'Alto explains how a recent technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" reveals human emotions in pictures. This is actually rather convincing to believe. How can you identify a picture's emotions through a new software? The use of the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" used to read facial emotional expressions is not valuable to students in classroom because it seems too expensive for a public school to use, it looks to be more useful at images, and video games.

""Facial Action Coding System"" is not useful to students in a classroom because it is expensive and mostly unaffordable for all classes. D'Alto explains what this technology is made up of, and its component looks expensive. On paragraph 3 the author explains that, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" (D'Alto 3) Having a 3-D model computer in classes not less than a hundred is money consuming and might ruin the school's budget. Having such prestige technology in class does not mean the students in the classroom will learn better or try changing their facial expressions.

Also, most of these type tehnologies are useful mainly at expensive images such as Mona Lisa portrait. This type of system only helps solve the mysteries behind old images such as Mona Lisa and not students' emotions. The author reveals that. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" (D'Alto 6) This shows that the Facial Action Coding System is mainly useful for such mystery portraits. It only helps solve people's curiosity rather than help students in classrooms.

Lastly the new technology also help make computer expressions more real in video games. Dr. Huang explains that, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive__ for video games or video surgery."" (D'Alto 6) This evidence shows that the new software is more valuable at helping video gemes to look more real than helping students to study harder or to succeed.

Lastly, the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" is not relevant for students in classroms because it is unaffordable, mainly useful for expensive portraits, and video games. There are many disadvantages than advantages for using the new technology at schools. The new system is more useful at video games and expensive portraits such as Mona Lisa's than in schools.",4

Cars that can drive themselves can also be alot safer for the people traveling inside them and for the people around them. Smart cars will sense the world around them, and they can help make things like trafic jams and road blocks safer for everyone involved. As the text states, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should take over. Other options under consederation are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads up dispalys. Manufacturers are also consiering useing cameras to watch that drivers are remaning focused on the road. While the driver watches the road. the car watches the driver."" This quote from the text tells us that the smart cars will alart us when danger is ahead so that we will be prepared. This will help prevent colisions with other cars and pedestions.

Allthough the driver will still have to be paying attention o the road, he or she could relax knowing that they are in the hands of a smart driverless car. In the text it says,""We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way."" This quote is saying that the driverless cars will be a fun alternative to the manual cars we drive today. The new smart cars will be a relaxing and fun car for the future.

The driverless car has many positive facters, but it also has a few negative facters. There is the posabitaly that the car can malfuction, or not sense an accident.

The driverless car will take time to perfect, but when it is complete it will be a masterpice.

Smart driverless cars are the future. They can provide safety like cars today can not. They are also a more fuel effecent way of transportation.

venus is getting referred as earths ""Twinn"" over time humans have been sending numerouse spacecrafts to land on the cloud-draped world where no spacecraft is able to survied the landing for no more the a few hours . There a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxdie blankets venus in our solar system. But did you kniw the avergae temperature is over 800 degrees one hot planet. Did you also know that farenneit and the atmosheric pressure is also 90 times greater that what humans experience on our own planet . Notable venus has the hottest sureface temperatue or any planet in our whole solar systam. They say that the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probe seeking to land on its sureface. Wow our planet is so inhospitble it includes valleys and mountains and craters . so instand od sending spacecraft out they used a computer that was made in the 1800 cause that computer that does not require using electroics this computer goes off on of calculations by using gears and levers modern computer are enormously powerful , flexible and quick to extreme physical conditions . Humans will likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors . to where it should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and invaion to the challenge of exploring venus.   ",1
05fa43a,"Using this technology that could read emotional expressions of students is very valuable. Imagine someone acting to be really happy with a big smile in their face, and then actually being upset about something. The article had a lot of possitive points about this technology.

A lot of people would say no to this technology because they are getting checked by a computer. Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling. It can calculate how you feel just by constructing your face and seeing how all 44 mucles of your face are.

Dr. Huang says ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresion."" He is trying to say that even when people try to change the way their face acts. The computer may still know how your actual emotions are. These new technology is so amazing because it can even be on your own PC.

Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. These new technology can actually calculate every emotion. Even if it is in the past.

All these amazing things about this technology should be valuable in classroom. The students would be able to study new things about how this actually works. How it can make everyone feel better about it. The students actually doing this things with these technology would actually make them a bit happier. This is why this technology that reads expressions should be valuable in a classroom. ",3
05ff7b3,"Now you can actually know how thye feel by an app. This is now something that is being used to recognise the emotions of old paintings and it might actually be good for people. it will be able to tell how you really feel, it can hlp kids in school. and it also helps produce emotions.

We all know someone that says they are fine but they think something else, but we cant fingure out how they also feel. But with this new program it will be way easier and that is a good thing. ""the software can even identifiy mixed emotions.... each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)."" Since this software can tell peoples emotions it could help in therapy with things, like if a person comes in for therapy but says they feel good about it but they dont act like it the therapist could do this test and see what they are having trouble with or how they really feel about the subject at hand.

Some kids can get bored in school and just zone out because the material they are being taught does not click with them but that can be changed with this new program. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Dr. huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" this could benifit both the school system and the child. the child will be more attentive with the lesson if he or she understands it or they think it is interesting and then they might even score higher in school, and have a better futre.

Some people might just look mean when you walk by them, or it may even be you that always gets asked ""You always look mad so i dont talk to you."" nut now since this program came out, the theory that comes with it is that it can help you produce new emotions. "" According to the Facial feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them."" this can benifit poeple in many ways. They might become happier and more out going. They could have better oppertunities when it comes to work because they have a good attutide.

This new facial feedback could be really good for us as people. it could halp many peoplr in thier lifes. ",3
06041d8,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the auhtor did not make enough evidence and information on why it would be of great value to explore our twin planet, Venus. Most the article was relaying challenges, or risks, as some might say, and probable solutions to those risks. The part in the article on why it would be of great value to study Venus does not give us a lot of reason why.

For most of the articel the author was giving was reasons why there unmanned missons to visit and why a single spaceship has not touched down on Venus in more than three decades. One reason as he explain was Venus's atmosphere. Another was the enivornment of our neighboring planet Venus.

Mostly the other part of the article was soltuions to Venus's challenges. He talk about how NASA had an idea to use an blimp-like trasnportation to avoid Venus's harsh enivorment. He also explained NASA's othe plan to use mechanical computers some modern technology wouldn't burn up and melt due to Venus very humid temperatures.

At the end of the article, in the last paragraph, is where the author briefly gave he reason for why studying Venus would be a good idea. He brings up recieveing insight on the planet. Also he brings up the hunger human curiosity and that it will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Based on the information explained in this essay, the reason is now known why the author did not do a good job supporting why explorating Venus would be of great value.

I believe that it is i good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring to you, help you understand what you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

One reason why it is a good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring for you. The computer can help find a video or something that can help the work be for fun or extced for you. For example, say that I do not like math or i can not figure out what the answer is because i am bored the computer can find a video to help me.

Another reason, is it can help you learn something you do not know. For example say the teacher does not explain a problem correctly and so the computer looks up a video or something that can explain the problem.

Last reason, is the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

For example the computer will look at your face and will see that you can not do a problem and sees your frustration and the computer will look uo an article,video,etc.. that will help you and it will give you instuctions on how to do something.

In conclusion, as you can see the technology to read the emotinal expressions of student's is a great idea because it can help you something that boring to you, help you understand something that you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.            ",3
0607ed1,"Dear senator,

I would like to say that the electoral college is not what we should be using to elect our presidents. I think the electoral college is not what Americans need. In the electoral college process, many thing could go wrong. The system does not work as many people think it does, as it is very deciving and unfair. Over half of all voters agreed that we should abolish the system and go by popular vote.

The electoral college is unfair due to the fact that peoples vote is not even going to the president but for his electors. The biggest moral of the country is ""we the people"" have control. The trickery of the electoral college is not allowing this to happen but taking it away. It is mainly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. The electoral college interfered in the the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush by allowing Bush to win even though more people voted on Al Gore in popular vote.

The many flaws in the system or mistake that can happen are more likely in the electoral college. The is a possibility that the two presidents can tie and in which case they have to go through a long process. This can happen due to an even number of electoral votes overall (538). The electors in the state of Louisiana have refused to vote for their party's canidate and vore for whoever they please ant that is not right. You can pay electors to vote one way which is also wrong too considering that not what the people think.

Many people agree that they system should be abolished including two presidents the united states Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Over half of all voters at over 60% agree that the system should be abolished. These statistics were taken in a Gallup Poll in 2000 shortly after Al Gore was not elected. The Obama vs. Romney race was won by Obama who had 61.7 % of the electoral votes versus he had only 51.3 % of the popular votes.

That's it! The electoral college is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"" as Bradford Pulmer clearly staes it. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis of reality. Due to the many flaws and/or mistakes that can happen the electoral college should not be used. I have to agree with Nixon and Carter: ""Abolish the Electoral college!""                                                    ",3
0608495,"The future is coming. Many new technologies will be developed over the next few years, and ideas that people have had for decades will finally have the possibility of becoming a reality. Flying cars, human-like robots, anything you can possibly imagine could very well be introduced into our future.

Although many new problems will arise with these new developments, setbacks such as driving/traffic laws, or the argument of who would be at fault in case of an accident will only be a ripple in the ocean that is our technology. These devices should most definitely be tested for years to come before they even begin to release it into the population, but in the end, I certainly agree that they could furiously enhance our style of living, and ultimately, safety for those around us.

For any of these ideas to become a reality, there is going to have to be many years of testing ahead, and many trials and errors, but in order for the human race to move forwards, as it has in the past, there are always risks and precautions that need to be taken, and warnings that we must heed. In the pass, countless lives have been taken in the name of science and technology, and I highly doubt that as we move forwards into our future, that will change much. People will always struggle to further the comfort of their living, even if that means taking from other people. It makes me wonder if technology such as this is actually going to be beneficial for our society. As I think about the health risks and funding needed for advances such as these, not to mention the threat of war from other countries, I begin to realize that maybe we will reach a point in the future where technology will no longer be beneficial to us, but instead, be counterproductive in the overall wellbeing of the world.

When all the facts are laid before me, with no deceit hidden behind fine print, only then will I believe that technological advances can only bring good into this world. Even today, it is becoming more and more apparent that social media and cellphones have altered our way of communication. No longer do we have to go outside to see people, or have conversations face to face, so that means that our world has become much smaller, yet also much bigger at the same time. Human confrontation may be a rare thing in thirty years, maybe even five. Although I, and most anyone else, enjoy the comfort of our technologies and lifestyle right now, there will most definitely come a time, maybe in the near future, where we regret pushing to try to make our life easier. Only time will tell when people begin to discover new ways to harm others, and when that time comes, we will regret ever pushing this far. ",3
0608fab,"In the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" Have many advantages, but i feel that the main advantage is that it is good for the planet and to lower air pollution and aslo the movement is actually working.

Helping out the planet and staying green in some way is a good thing because it helps our planet look better not only that it makes it look better but it also makes us humans and the planet Earth healthier for example the air pollution can be lowered by driving cars less,instead od driving your own car you could take the bus,walk, or ride like in the text it says

""Its's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""

I like this piece of evidence because it tels more on how being green can not only help the planet but alo tell how it can help human kind, because it helps you understand not only it can lower pollution but it can also lower your stress, but if you choice not to go along with the movement you shouldn't have to pay a fine of 5$ because to me it seems like that would be taking away a persons rights yes i get it ""

The goal is to promote altnative transportatin and reduce smog""

but a person should not be force to do so.

Another advantage could be that the movement is working

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

I like this piece of evidence from ""Source 4: The End of Car Culture"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal because it states what the president is doing to try and make our planet better, but not only that it also gives factual information by telling about fewer cars are being broughten each year and also fewer licenses are also being gotten

All in all this passage have many good advantages to help persuade people to start driving less and helping out our planet, One it is good for our planet because no one wants to live in a dirty place, Two it will help lower the bad air pollution, and Lastly is that the movement is working anyways so why not try and help out and drive a little less?                    ",3
060a4e7,"In the passage the Author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents. In the first paragraph the author says ¨Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.¨. In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. In paragraph two it says ¨Often referred to as Earths ¨twin¨, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. In the passage in paragraph three it says ¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it. My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way.",1
060d2bb,"Everyone think's that it is a face that was created by aliens but its not. The thing that appears to be a face is not a face it is simply a natural landform. It is a natural landform because on April 5, 1998, global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a photo of the so called alien artifact. Their photo was ten times better than the original Viking photo so that meant they could get a better view out of it. After looking over the photo they found out that is was no alien arttifact.

But people were not satisfied. So on april 8, 2001 a summer day in Cydonia the global surveyor drew closer for a second look. As they rolled the spacecraft 25 degress to the center of the

face they took an extrordinary photo. Using the cameras absolute maximum resolution for the photo. That means for each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

You can discern things in a digital photo 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So that means if the human lookin landform was an alien artifact u would be able to see airplans on the ground. Egyption-stye pyramids, and even small shacks. But what the phoyo acually shows is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.",3
0613e60,"My position on driverless cars is that it is a dumb idea. It is not likley we will have them, right now they can only get up to 25 miles per hour. That is not a very fast car or at least not fast enough. We would have to change the speed limits, people would not be able to get to work on time. These are reasons I think the idea is stupid.

25 miles per hour is not a very fast car or at least not fast enough. Think about this, mostly all of our speed limits get up to 30 to 35 miles per hour. so what i am saying is that all the construction that would have to take place would be over whelming. In the text it said the car has a warning system to alert drivers about construction or wrecks. the system would be going crazy.

People would not be able to get to work on time. When a car we use now verses a ""smarter"" car the problems would be reliability and speed. In a modern day car we can sync our phones to them and have gps tell you where to go. If a modern car runs out of gas on the highway you can pull over, locate and walk to the nearest gas station with a gallon container and get more gas, then you could walk back to your car and put the gas in your car. Now with a ""smarter"" car it comes with a gps system, sure. If the ""smarter"" car however runs out of energy your navigation system will not work, and you would have to, in some way shape or form, get your car to a charging station then you will have to wait a while before its charged up and ready to go.

In conclusion those are the reasons I toatly dissagree with people that want ""smarter"" cars on the road. You can not rely on them . They are dumb and will not be able to function properly in todays society.",3

061ba37,"Is it really, good if u dont use a car day to day? People in Europe have started this new trend of having different suburbs to not have cars. Now, Paris is banning driving due to smog. Also, Clolombia now has a car-free day that made people bike, hike and aslo take buses to work making the streets have less traffic jams. The U.S, one of the most car used nations, has been going down, and in April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was the same as in January 1995. Experts are also thinking that if they encourage people to reduce the usage of cars, that it may help the greenhouse gases problem gradualy.

So one suburb that is already been established and made an car-free zone is Vauban, Germany. This suburb has minimal parking spots and people have easy access to stores. A woman said,

""When i had a car i always tense. I'm much happier this way""

. This movement of making places car-free is called

""smart plannig""

. ""In the U.S the Envoirmantal Protection Agency is promoting

""car redused""

communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.""

In Paris, people were fined if they did not leave their car at home. This was put into place, because smog was intensifying. Also, smog is more in Paris than in any other capital in Europe. Delivery companies lost revenue, but electric cars and public transit was free of charge. After, the smog cleared the odd ruling was rescinded.

Colombia had an idea that was put into place one day and made a change in everybody. They made a program which is a car-free day which made people go hiking, biking and they rode buses to work. It made the streets clearer. It was put into place so that it woulg help the reduction of smog. This peogram helps people to know other ways to transport themselves without cars.

The U.S is the nation that has the most cars used. So, now they are trying to decrease the use of cars. A study showed that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009.

These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",4

0630503,"I would not think having the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is valuable. The fact that not alot of people want others to know how they feel . Especally teens these days. Teenagers hide alot of emotions for multiple reason. Simply because it can lead to alot of questioning about their life. Not everyone would want people to know what goes on in their life that makes them depressed or sad.

Eckman classified 6 basic emotions - happiness, suprise , anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Why would anyone want anyone else to know if they'er sad or disgusted? What if you was talking to some one and they had an awful smell . Then , the Facial Action Coding System just show how disgusted you are. That would not only hurt the other person's feelings but make you feel mean.

Dr. Huang noted ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" ""So computer need to understand that , too"" . Most human are nonverbal because they chose not to be. Not every one just want to sit not and talk about their feelings. Also, Dr. Huang noted , ""So computers need to understand that , too. Understand what? How might a computer understand?

People in our world today are becoming so intellegent that they can invent anything they set thier minds to.

First of all, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900's, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come.

Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and thier dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the drivers seat of an actual moving vehical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true.

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

Not always.""[Plumer, p10].When voters vote for the Electoral college the person they put in might not even vote for who the people want for the President. The system is not only unfair when people vote, also when campagins happen in states. In paragraph 13 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , the author states ""Because of the winner-takes-all system... candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."". With this system, we have some states that are left out of the campaign of candidates going through states, because they are not important to the candidate for winning.

In addition, not only is the Electoral college unfair, the system can fail at any given election. Plumer wrote in paragraph 11 ""...what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress."" the Electoral college is only to have one slate of electors from each state. With two slates from one state it would give both the state and the candidate an advantage over the rest of the states and the other candidate, that would turn into a disater. Not only can the states destory the Electoral college system, the system can destory itself.  Included in paragraph 12, "" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."". Even the people put into the college can ruin themselves by one or two electoral voters changing their minds.

Not everything about the Electoral college is bad. The article

In the Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our reasons despised method of choosing the President said, ""..it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.""[Posner, p18]. Even the other vote systems are strongly disliked. The Electoral system is not the most disliked system but it can also get the President everyone wants. In paragraph 19,""... a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."". A candidate for the president can't focus on one region, because it will make other states feel that they are not important.

Finally, the Electoral college should no longer exist because, it's an unfair system and can quickly turn into a catastrophe.    ",4
0640183,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author Nick D'Alto desribes how a new technologhy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion changes . Human changes are when a person can feel a little happy ,but more sadder. In this essay today I will explain how I think whether the use of the technology should be used in the classroms , based off what iv'e just read .

Based off what i just read in the text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile "" the author Nick, was explaining about how the emotion changes to Mona Lisa expressed how she felt based off cacualations using technology. In the beginning of the txet the author talked about the caculations emotions .For an example in the text text the author quoted "" She's 83 perenct happy, 9 perecnt disgusted ,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science

teacher , grading your lastest lab assignment . "" After , reading that example, you should have a question asking "" How did they know that "" ? .The answer to that question is rare , they knew how much percentages of each emotion was worth

because they caculated it using technology and her body strcutered muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus. That helps shows the crow-feet aroud the eyes to vertify the emotions ; bsaed off body languages.

I feel that classroms need this computred based technology because it'll tell the teacher wether if a student is feeling good, bad, or okay . I know this because according to the text the author Nick was explaing the caculations of Mona Lisa . It explained her emotions and even the percentages of the emotions. I can connect this to when I was in 3rd grade. I was getting ready for the ISAT test. That day i was not feeling good, I was feeling 80 perecnt worries , 5 perent happy, and 25 percent sad. I did not move to the next grade all because of i was worried about how will I do on the test instead of getting it out the way . My teacher couldn't tell my emotions because my emotions was hidden in silence . That's why I feel this technonlogy should be used in classrooms, but if it is being used in the classroms I hoep it change the looks at things .

After, reading my essay I hope you get a good understanding why iv'e thought it was best to have the technology in classrooms . The caculations will explain how each student is feeling each day of class. The computer will show the progress of an happy , sad , worried, or okay student . A student actions and emotions explains their feelings ,but not the percentages. However, I hope teachers and instructors chose to have the computer based technology to explain a students emotions.         ",3
0640912,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. The idea of automatic cars has been around for a long time. Technology was not as advanced as it is now. Improvements in computer software is going to help make driving safer and is leading to cars that can handle more difficult tasks on their own.

Having driverless cars is a great idea. There are a lot of benifits of having driverless cars. In paragraph 1 it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world"". Having driverless cars would lower the number of deaths and crashes. Imagine someone being drunk and wanting to drive home. Having a driverless car would help that situation a lot less dangerous.

There are a lot of negative things about driverless cars. Having one of these cars would still require attention and assistance. In paragraph 7 it states, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. The necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs"". If someone is drunk or on drugs how will they know when a problem occurs? Not everyone is going to be fit to have a driverless car.

There are a lot of things a driverless car can do much better than a human can do. In paragraph 7 it states, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph...They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."". If a person is unable to break fastly the car will do it. Having a automatic car can help the person worry less because the car will help get them to their destination safely and hopefully on time. Maufacturers are also going to consider using cameras to watch the drivers and make sure they are focused on the road. An automatic car would be good in a situation if someone gets a phone call or a text message. Even though they are supposed to be watching road it will still make it less dangerous. In paragraph 8 it says, ""..Something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"".

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. There are more positive things about a driverless car than negative. Some say why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW manager driver states, "" We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way"". The idea of driverless cars will further be an idea and the negatives will be improved. Maybe one day there will be a true driverless car.      ",4
0642363,"I believe that driverless cars are a bad idea. There are issues that can be seen to cause problems. The idea of a computer doing something for you takes out the factor of doing it yourself.

If a computer beggins to start to do the work for us when wont have any work to to do which, sounds beautiful but, in reality can become a disaster. If we let a computer do something for us like drive, then we can end up never learning things like driving which is a huge part in the dalay teens life. I am a teen and I believe that if I were to be given a car that drives itself i would never use it for the simple fact i dont get to use what ive learned in drivers ed to use.

I could go on with many issues with this idea. Like, if a computer were to mess up and wreak the car who would to be at blame? Would it be the driver or the manufacturer? These are some issues that could efect people.

I just believe that cars that drive themselves are would become a bigger issue then what people think. Other people can think their oppion on the subject. But, that is just my personal oppion.",2

Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France baned Driving do to smog. Sounds Extream, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely ""

Car-Free

"". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an aditional $40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of Vauban's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA (

Environmental Protection Agency

) is promoting ""

car reduced

"" communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a car-free day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they baned driveing all togather. France desided that they where going to order even-numbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Same for odd-numbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and car-free campains have helped our environment. These countried have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to partisipate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of car-free suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.            ",4
0649f8e,"I think that you should get rid of the electoral college because it makes the popular vote unfair. If you are saying we aren't voting for the president we want then we are just voting for the electoral voters we want without knowing that. The electoral college is unfair because if we vote who we want to then we will just get the votes of some electoral voter and if we vote for them they could vote for whoever they wanted to vote for.

If everyone voted for someone thew electoral voters could just vote for whoever they wanted to and we wouln't be able to stop them either. We should change it to popular vote because the electoral college is unfair to everyone who votes for someone. Its not fair because the eletoral vote can make a president lose even if he had the popular vote is on his side.

It should be changed because there is always the disaster factor. If their is a tie then they will just deny the will of the people.

0657f4c,"What is electoral college? The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your canadate you are actually voting for your canadates electors. I think electoral collage is is a stupid process and is definitly outdated.

In the same light, I think the electoral collage is a stupid idea beacause and that they should of got rid of it a long time ago it is like were not even voteing annymore its like someone messed up the votes and said that romney got 538 votes and obama only got 438 votes. Like bob dole said,""abolish the electoral college"".

but you have to remember, the electoral college is a good thing to most presendental elections. the only one election that it didnt help on was in 2000 al gore recived more indivisial votes than george bush nationwide, but bush won the election, reciveing 271 electoral votes to gore 266.

065c240,"Outer space is a mystery within itself, but the addition of the planets and stars are just an expansion to those mysteries. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was written for readers to understand how a planet that may be different in design can be the most important reason as to why it should be taken a look at. The author compares and contrasts Venus with Earth and Mars to emphasize what Venus has to offer. Venus may not be the easiest task to complete, but that should encourage people to push the exploration of the planet.

Venus may have a variation of attributes compared to Earth and Mars, but that shouldn't stop people from exploring the planet. Since Earth and Venus are considered ""twins,"" they are similar according to their, ""...density and size, and occasionally their distance too."" (2) The author also mentions how Venus could have once been the, ""...most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" With that being said, if Venus was similar to Earth in its lifetime, then it could answer pondering questions like ""Is there any other signs of life on other planets?"" Just like Earth, Venus has, ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" (4) Venus' similar characteristics to Earth makes it an interesting mission for scientists.

Sending man to the moon wasn't the easiest trip, but it got done. So, why shouldn't Venus be explored too? Venus is said to have, ""...hostile conditions on the surface,"" (5) and it is considered, ""inhospitable."" (4) Both phrases do not appear to be the most promising when deciding if landing on Venus is the best choice, but beyond those risks could be life changing discoveries. This mission is impossible because humans are able to make, ""machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully.""

Traveling to Venus doesn't have to be the most difficult plan. Space travel already is a timely mission, but Venus is said to, ""...sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" If Venus is a close visit, then scientists should be even more compelled to search the planet. Scientist have come up with smart ideas to observe Venus like, ""a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape."" (5) With this the vehicle is close enough to explore without humans dying or the vehicle frying. The heat is dangerous, but scientists could obtain important information they've been wanting to find out.

The author informs readers on the risks of traveling to Venus. Venus is not the safest place to be close to, but dangers have never stopped people from making trips into space in the past. Venus provides many opportunities that people have to be willing to take and learn from. Danger is nothing new to society, so traveling to Venus is only the newest obstacle to bypass. ",4
06633fa,"Cars are grate inventions. We use it to move our selves and other things from place to place. Its faster and easier but all grate things have their flaws. Having a car has its advantages and disadvantages. Sure they do help a lot but if you really look into it you are causing more damage using a can than when you don't. Using a car causes car accidents and hurts our environment with harmful gasses well known as the greenhouse affect. limiting your self to usage of your car can really help a lot. I surly am cutting back on using my car because I love my environment, do you?

Cutting back on usage of car can save you a lot of money and prevent accidents from happening. when there are less cars on the road it reduces accidents with bikers, walker, and other cars. when you are involved in a car accident you someone gets hurt and you lose money. car accidents are costly. the insurance goes up, your medical bill has to be paid, the gas you used or lost, and your out of work because of you injury. that's just part of it. you have to still think about the damage you caused and have to live knowing you killed or could have killed an innocent person. money loss doesn't happen just when your in an accident. just by being a safe driver u lose money also. having a car means having to deal with insurance, mechanic, and gas. gas prices are very expensive now in days. sometimes you have to skip a meal because you only have enough for gas that day. cutting back could save you hundreds yearly even if u cut back maybe two times a week. just think about it you can prevent an accident from happening and save money just by staying home,walking, or riding a bike.

Saving money and preventing car accidents is not the only reasons you should cut back on car usage. another reason is because it hurts our environment. for every car that is being used our environment is being hurt. a car lets off bad gasses that cause the green house affect. this is not just hurting the area that we live in its also hurting other areas all over the world. the gasses that cars make is making our world heat up and ice and glaciers are getting defrosted. this harms the polar bears and causes water levels to rise and less land for us. cutting back on usage of cars can help not just us as people but our plants and animals all over the world. if u don't want to do it for the world do it for your self. cutting back and using a bike, walking or public transportation can be good for you. using a bike and walking is good exercise for you and can be a weekly thing. using public transportation can help you meet new people and make friends and get to know people. cutting back doesn't really have to be weekly even if its just one or twice every other month can still really help. if you have the choice to stay and cook or go out and eat then try to stay home and hey who knows maybe you can learn a new recipe.

Cutting back can save a life, our environment, save money, and be a healthy thing. just think about all those cute polar bears and other animals you could be saving. oh, lets not forget the plants also. just plan a day that you will just ride your bike to work and on your ride think of all the good things your doing for our community so go ahead save the environment, save your self.         ",3
06673c8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" the author states how our technology is increasing so much today, that soon we will see cars that drive themselves. The author states some negative sides to the story, and some positive. But I think that driverless cars will help our country in many different ways, and I support it.

According to the author, he says will we even be able to make new cars because there are laws that do not allow some states to test them. According to the article, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars""(9). I think car manufacturers can test their cars in a factory in some states that it is legal to do it in, and once they prove that it is safe I believe that some states will uplift the laws that they have on self driving cars.

Also many people ask, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer""(9)? This is one of the main concerns of people today, but I would believe it would be the manufacturers fault since they were the ones who made the car, and designed all the parts of it. Humans should have no worry about liability for themselves because the car manufacturers should cover all the expenses that happened in the accident since they were the ones who designed the cars.

Another benifit to self driving cars is that they also would reduce half the fuel that humans use today. Accorting to the text it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world""(1). Not using half the amount of fuel today is super benificial for the enviornment since we are not polluting it nearly as much. Many people would support this because we would be help save the enviornment, and also we would not have to spend nearly as much money on gas as we normally do. Another benift is how all the cars would be safe. According to BMW,""Safety is a big concern""(8). Clearly BMW would not release the car if it was not safe, but if our country all switches to self driving cars then this will reduce the crashes, and accidents by a ton, which would be saving many lives.

Many automakers are working on developing new safety gadgets for cars, and also a couple of the automakers have alrady developed a self driving car. Tesla for example, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time""(10). Tesla has projected that they will release a car in 2016 that 90% of the time is on autopilot. That is this year, and when they release it all the other automakers are going to try and design a better self driving car than the tesla which could make the other manufacturers come out with a new self driving car soon also. Some other automakers have said, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"" (10). This is crazy so by the time 2020 at least three more auto makers predict that they will have self driving cars also. By the 2020s we should expect my self drivin cars that will be on the road.

In conclusion there are many positives/ benifits that will come out of this self driving car. Though there are some set backs that some states/ automakers will have to over come. In the end outcome it will help drivers safety, and it will help the enviornment. In the overall outcome that is why we should have self driving automobiles.    ",4
0667fd7,"Scientist believe they have came up with a technology that can read your true emtions called FACS, or Facial Action Coding System. This technology works your emotions out like a math equation. It calculates the feelings of fear, happiness, disgust, surprise, anger, and sadness. Now they are thinking that it can be great in the classroom and benefit schools tremendously.

Feeling are told all over your face and your body language, all someone really has to do is pay attention. In the classroom though, it is very hard for one teacher to see how each child individually feels. New technology that has sprung up can do that for them now. This technology uses video memory and software that decodes the muscles in facial expressions. This could be very beneficial in the classroom because now you can see how your children feel about your lessons, and that could develope new ways to help students learn. The auhtor writes how Dr. Huang says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". ""Then it could modify the lesson like, like an effective human instructor."", this would be very wise to put in a classroom. Teachers want to know all the time what they can do for their students and how; new technology could do it for them.

Although this idea could be genius, it could have flaws just like most technology. It is hard to truly depict someones emotions, so how can a computer tell someone how they feel? Or honestly, what does a few pieces metal know about how someone is feeling? People could also say this creation is very invasive.These claims could be arguements presented when getting this type of technology into the classroom.

Even though this technology could have flaws to it,

people will never kbow till they try. They have sent pyschologists, like Dr.Paul Eckman, in to help perfect the FACS. The computer software can even predict your true emotions, regardless if you put on a fake smile. It knows what muscles are used in a fake and in a real smile. Humans use the same skill everyday according to the author, our only difference is we have trouble actually describing the emotion.

In conclusion, FACS, a system that can calculate your feelings, would be a great additon to the classroom. We introduce new technology everyday that is not benefical to schools, so why not help the school sytem. Every technology has its kinks, but who truly knows until it is tested.",3
0668f09,"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coinsided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning cars/reducing them will benefit our ecosystems and enviornments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog; it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing (Source 2). That CO2 rises into the air, the atmopshere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of car-pooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3; and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael Sivak brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine (19 and 21) [speaking of her children] have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the enviornment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the city/town. In Bogota, Columbia (according to Source 3) new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks; DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the enviornment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and check-up like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.                                            ",5
0670d67,"Driving into the Future

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheal vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that proccess situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and elliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can proccess situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival itme. Smart cars, as the leading industrys call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintaing eyes on the road. These cars are maintaing a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safley navigate out of it and overide the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, drving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainley choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",5

Driverless cars are not a good because why create a car that drives on its own but still needs assistance from a person. Driveless cars does come with special sensors such as; position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor, but with all that technology why does it need assistance. The cars we drive today does not have all that fancy sensoring but it does have some that really comes in handy. Driverless cars can steet, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as; navigating through work zones and around accidents. To save the stress of you having to take control of the wheel if you run into a problem than why not keep you car, the cars we drive now. Without any navigation or all that fancy stuff we will always have our eyes on the roads and knowing when to turn, stop, go and all that good stuff.

No matter how good a driverless car sounds I still don't think its a god idea. I feel as if its just a waist of money and products when there's more importnat things going on in the world that still hven't been fixed. Driverless cars are safe until a drunk driver or a persons who's high off something get in a dosen't pay attention to what that navigator is telling you, the same with texting and driving. So why risk someone lives when if they are driving the cars we use now more people pay attention to the roads, not many drink and drive, more and more people everyday are paying attention to the roads. ",3
0674a38,"Driverless cars would not be a smart step forward for us as Americans. Considering the fact the car can not fully function on its own it would be very difficult to deal with. If the car has to ask the driver to take over everytime it can't handle a certain situation, then make one that can and then we can advance into the new era of driverless cars.

The fact that Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver, says people would get bored behind the weel of a car controlling itself proves that people would lose focus and that may cause fatalities. When they lose focus because the car is in control and look at their phone, the car may ask them to take over on the drop of a dime, and the driver may panick. Especially if there is an oncoming car and the driverless car can not react fast enough, because it only takes a split second.

Another point I would like to make is when big name companies such as Google market anything they sell simply because of who makes it. If there is a flaw in a cars system then they would be risking a lot of peoples lives, in terms of who buys them. In paragraph eight, it reads that "" Upgrading to existing roads would be too expensive to be practical."" and that means if there is a flaw under the hood, they would lose a lot of money from a bunch or attackers, manufacturers, and their own industry crumbling.

All in all, I believe that it would not be a good way to advance in technology if we're practically selling prototypes. People would be buying driverless cars that aren't state of the art because either it was too pricy or the car itself can not handle the surprises driving may consist of and it would be a major fail on a lot of people's behalf. If we had cars that could fully function safely and accurately on the street, then we could maybe experiment on making the future present. But for now, let us work ot the kinks of the products that affiliate with people's everyday lives or even their lives period.",4
06766be,"In a argument between against or for driverless cars, I am for driverless cars. I think it's a good idea to have driverless cars. It will safer on the streets. There

should be a whole new set of laws regarding to these cars. I also think they shouldn't be released until these cars are truly driverless.

As I said earlier driverless cars shouldn't come out until they are completely do not need a driver. When they are driverless it would resolve conflict between if there were an accident who the blame would be on. The blame would be on the company that made the car because the driver isn't doing anything. I think there should still be a mode in the car where the driver can takeover if the driver sees a situation where he should control the car. I think the car should be smart enough to know how to get through traffic jam, that shouldn't be a problem. The new laws should be that all cars will have to go a certain speed. I don't see how you could get in a car accident if they are all going the same speed. Even though most people would have a driverless car, some people will still have old cars that need a driver. So if there is an accident between a driverless car and a old car that requires a driver, I think the blame should be in the driver in the old car because the driverless car is following all the laws and is going a certain speed so if there was an accident it would be on the driver that isn't following the laws. But then again the driverless car could have technical difficulties and could crash. I think the car should know when it is having technical issues and pull over to the side so the driver can take control. Even though the car is driverless I think the laws for getting your license should not change. Also some people like to drive so the should be and option that is opposite to cruise control we the driver can drive, but when you are driving you have to be ready to take responsibility for anything that happens while you are driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a great idea. It would lead to less accidents as long as the car it programmed the right way. Texting and driving would be as big of an issue as it has been lately with a driverless car. With a driverless car there are less choices being made and less opinions. Our generation would be great to take on the challenge because we take on new things everyday with things being invented everyday. With all that being said I am for driverless cars. It is a great idea and would save lives also. ",3
0678715,"Driverless cars? A car doing all the driving for you without you having to touch the wheel is of lazy. Why would you want a ""smar car"" do all the work for you. The more that the technology develops the more things people find to help you be more lazy. It's like people don't want to do anything themselves anymore.

When driving you really have to pay attention to not just yourself but other people. If you let the smart car drive you around it's not going to really be paying attention to other people. If you get in an accident and the other person gets hurt, who is to blame you, or the car? The cops will go with you, because you are an human being that can get arrested and pay insurance, not the car. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?""

So, I don't think we should have driverless cars. I believe there would be more accidents than there is now. When it comes down to it yes, this will be our future, but we can also prevent it from happening. Its all up to you.",2
0679f5a,"The author does a very good job at explaining and giving details of the passage.They give you the scientific facts and even tells you that NASA has been working on diffrent ways to study Venus.He lets you know that Venus is not an easy planet to study since it has a top degrees of 800 degrees Farenheight. He also gives information about how diffrent metals and other objects melt and liquefy after so long on Venuses surface.

They give very good information on how NASA plans to get peopel to Venus by building a space craft that will hover 30 miles over the landscape of Venus. He gives muliple good facts about the spaace craft and how it will possible work. The author claims it will work like airplanes and a blimp, However it will still be hot 30 miles up. It will still be 170 degrees up there.They also give you the bad parts of having a hover craft over Venus for example the visibility of the landscapes and terrian. They also explain how you can't take samples from the ground hovering 30 miles over the land.

The author also gives creat detail of Venuses surface and how NASA has been thinking of diffrent ways to approach it. They give facts about the ground and the atmospherer around Venus and how the Atmosperic pressure is 90 times greatewr then we have experience with.The author also tells us how it's blanketed with 97 percent Carbon diocide and other gasses. We are even told that the conditions are to extream for us and how the presure would crush a submarine.

In the passage he describes how it's one of the brightest points in the sky. The author even tells us how a amerture could even find it. Venus is also described as our twin planet. It is also wrote in the passgae on how close it resembles our planet even though it could crush and kill anyone. The author also adds on how hard Venus is to examine with all the storms and comotion on its ground.

Venus even has volcanoes that erupt on it's surface. It has Earthquakes and even occasional lightning storms. The author has definetly done a very good job on explaining his point on exploring Venus. He has put the good and the bad facts into the passage. He describes almost every aspect of the planet.The author aslo beleives that it will be good for us to try and explore Venus because we will be able to go one more dangerouse trips in the future.",4
067a23d,"The author supported his ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". He explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe he did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. He didnt just focus on one thing he focused on it all and he put his paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how he restated the question that he had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs he learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that he explained both bad and good thing about venus. He sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about and he knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ",2
067d842,"Many people arent sure what to do when it comes to election. Electoral College is the process that consist of the election. I believe that Electoral College is the easist way to handle the way of voting. Any ways whats wrong with Electoral College almost half the people agree to it.

The founding father that discovered Electoral College made it easy for anybody to be president. Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. On the other hand many people belive that Electoral College is unfair to some people. Many people want to abolish Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be declared the candidate who recives the most popular votes. The electoral restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate. The Electoral college avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion I think that Electoral College should stay and it will make things easier for all these reasons I listed from the sources. Also all the presidents will have a chance to become what they want to be.            ",2
0681136,"Many believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. There are many conspiracy theories, but scientists say the Face is simply just a natural landofrm. Cydonia was first discovered in May of 2001, and since then has had people baffled by the human-like structure. Though it may be easy to believe that this landform is the creation of aliens on Mars, it is just a natural rock formation on the red planet.

Aliens not been proven to be living in the universe with a secret ancient civilization. Though some people might believe this is untrue, NASA has yet to find evidence to support it. If scientists knew Cydonia was created by aliens, they would definetly want to investigate this further. With this new information, just like any new discovery, it would open up so many different ideas about the universe that do not exist today. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger thatn the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" With the extremely advanced technology we have today, scientists have been able to take more pictures of this landform, further proving that it is a natural creation, and that there is no alien civilization hiding in the depths of it's shadows.

Cydonia has many conflicting opinions on how it was created. Many citizens still strongly hold on to their ideas about this landform. It has been proved by NASA that this formation is not created by aliens, nor is there any living organisms with secret colonies on Mars. People have the choice to believe what they want, but scientists know the truth behind the Face on Mars. ",3
0683ac3,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valubale in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. In paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. It would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. In paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could know and then ask them whats wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. It could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. In paragraph 6, the author states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it help tell how students are feeling. Also it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions. Next time you see a facial expression try telling what emotion that it applies to.",3
0687af4,"Driverless cars will bring great benefits to the human race. They can provide a level of safety that many people are unable to provide, and they can allow for new freedoms and options for those on the road. They can take people to the hospital if someone is injured, and they can also bring a person to his/her home, if needed. The possibility of driverless cars is slowly becoming a reality, thanks to the work done by various companies. Google has already created a modified car capable of maky of these things, and other auto makers have followed in Google's footsteps. Automated cars will be helpful in the future due to the safety brought by the introduction of promising technology, and the steady progress in the fields of robotics and cars.

The technology used in driverless cars is very advanced, able to process information and respond in the time comparable to a human. They can respond generally better to dangerous situations than that of the human mind as well. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash""(2). These cars are trustworthy in a safety sense, and they know when it is neccessary to give control back to the driver.""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead repuires human skills""(7). This means that not all control is relinquished to the car. Truthfully, most of these driverless cars actually build from a driver assistance system, where the car helps the person drive rather that drive for the person. Automated cars can soon be possible for all of humanity.

Humanity has already come a long way from the past, when people would dream of robotic cars. Car companies have developed technologies that can make those dreams a reality. ""'There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.'"" Nowadays, cars are now able to have their own radar systems. Google modified a car to have a motion sensor, GPS, and four radar sensors. In the future, many automotive companies plan to have their own driverless cars. Tesla plans to have a car by 2016. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan will push to have automated cars by 2020. Progress is already happening in the car industry.

Driverless cars are a possibility for humanity. In the past, people would dream of being able to sit in a automated car. Today, the world's first robotic cars are being produced. There are those who oppose the idea of having a robot drive, but there are results that speak for the effectiveness of driverless cars. In the future, there will be many more automated cars, and there will also be many less deaths and injuries on the roads.",5
0689c67,"The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.

There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.

If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.

They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.

While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.                 ",5

With this new rule in place many things can change and improve. People will actually have to do a little research before voting on a president.

Firstly, Changing to election by popular vote for the president can cause a chain reaction. With this new rule the people of the United States will be forced to do solid research before making a vote that will benifit them. Reason being that with this new rule in place your vote is much more crucial then it was before. Doing this stops people from voting just because they like how someone looks, or because how they dress. The people will be voting because they want a president that will help the country. Using this method will improve and shape the country in an wonderful way.

Lastly, this new rule will cause more people to come out and vote. Because each vote will be ten times more essential then it was before. People come out knowing that if they dont vote, it will have a much bigger impact then it did before. The people are forced to decisions. This make for a healthy country that is made for the people.

Being driven by computer car can be very dangerous, it is not safe to not be driven by someone with a right mind. Computers can't do everything. Why would a human want to be driven by a car instead of a human?

Another thing is that you can help people and make someone happy. Don't you just love the joy you get when you help someone in need? Well you can have that feeling all the time if you volunteer because you are always helping people in need by giving them animals to eat.

For the record, you can see amazing monuments and other amazing things by just volunteering. You get to see these things for free because you have to go to some places like how I saw the Acropolis and I took a grondola ride so that was fun.

Something else is that you can get out of the drafts. I know because when I was on the ship, Iturned 18 and they said to keep going for my service and so that made me happy.

069cd67,"An idea for driverless cars does sound appealing. It can improve the intelligence of today's cars by giving them a mind of their own. However, these cars may seem like a decent idea for the future, but they can prove to be really difficult. Quite a few problems can arise from this phenomenon. The development for these driverless cars should cease pretty soon.

In the future, driverless cars are supposed to become a new thing. These cars will have the ability to function on their own and drive itself, which will not really require the driver to handle it. Although this seems like a nice thought, this is quite an issue already. Creating driverless cars can create laziness in lots of people. Assuming that this creation is titled 'driverless', many people will think that they do not have to do anything. This will raise the laziness in some people if this driverless car becomes available. This invention is not a good idea.

As well as it can raise laziness in people, it can quite possibly cause the driver to use it to his/her advantage in inappropriate ways. There is a law that says the driver must be held responsible for any mistakes he/she makes while on the road whether the car is automated or not. The driver will be at fault regardless if any acident is to happen. Even though this law exists, people will still make excuses for their mistakes. If an accident occurs, the driver may use the car as an excuse to avoid any responsibilities, such as court cases if anything is damaged. With such an invention as great as this, someone is most likely going to use it as a scapegoat for their mishaps. This just gives people a reason to avoid being guilty for what they did.

It is said that the car is supposed to maintain its commands and make driving easier. These driverless cars are supposed to work almost efficiently for everyone. However, accidents are still likely to happen. Even if these cars are supposed to work well, things can go wrong. Perhaps the car may somehow malfunction while on the road. If this happens, it will put the driver and other people on the road, driving or walking, at an extreme risk. If a malfunction in the car is to occur, accident and death rates will increase. This is extremely unsafe for drivers in the future.

It sounds great to have a car that can drive itself in the future. Maybe it might raise the intelligence of some drivers. Nevertheless, the possibilities of this new car going wrong should not be ignored. These cars cannot be 100% perfect at all times after its release.

We have taxi drivers that takes us where we need to go. Another reason is I would rather do it my self is because i enjoy driving, and I would be more than happy to take

myself where I need to go. My last reason about not wanting driverless cars because think about if they malfunction or if someone hacked into your car.

If we had driverless cars, we would be taking alot of peoples jobs that they depend on. Bus drivers, taxi drivers, shofurs would all be out of work and could now be lost in life. Not having anything other work

avalible for them becsuse they didnt go to collage or they just cant find a new job.

Another reason that

I belive we dont need driveless cars is because i enjoy driving and im sure im not the only only. But driverless cars would take the freedom feeling out of driving. Being able to go where you want, how you want, and when you want to. But what if your someone who likes to driver of roads in dirt, mud or any other terrian. The car that drives its self wouldnt do that bc it may be damaged or it may read that its a possibility of that.

My last thought on driverless cars are they have the potential to be very dangerous also its pointless to have one if you still have to be aware as if you were driving. But what if your just like antother day of you letting your car drive itself starts to have defects. A couple of those are that sometimes it rapidly picks up speed and slams on the brakes. Results you end up running someone over or you get into a bad accident. You have to take the blame for the mistake your car made. That could lead to big fines or even Jail time. Or what if someone hacks into your car and takes control of your car and try to hurt you by crashing it or they take you some where your not fimilliar with. As in they driver you out of state and you get lost.

So again I am one that is against driverless cars. they could put people out of work making peoples lifes ruined. It can take the thrill some get from driving. Also alot can go wrong if the car comes with flaws.

We helped so many people affected by the war. We took animals, food supply, and more to people whose countries were left in ruins from bombings, and other attacks of World War 2. So many people, that would have otherwise not have been able to do very well, got animals, food to feed their animals, and food for themselves. Helping them helped me to be more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all that serious though. We would play around on board, usually after all the animals had been unloaded, and we were heading back. We would have baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been kept. Table-tennis, fencing, and boxing were other sports we found a way to play. There were also things like reading, whittling, and games we used to help pass the time.

Along with our jobs, sightseeing was something we did everyday. I got a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. In Greece, I got to do something I think is pretty special. See the Acropolis. In Venice, Italy, I got to take a gondola ride on one of the many streets of water. I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal on the way to China.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy helped open up the world to me. Instead of being drafted into the military, I got to help people in need all over the world. When my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat, I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, and it really did turn out to be one!   ",3

It is just a rock formation without an alien monument. Landforms are not rare on other planets. Landforms come in all shapes and sizes so it just so happens to be a face.

When the scientist went back up to take picture and look at it more, they were able to take a clear picture of it. The scientist then blew it up to a bigger picture and saw that it was a natural landform.

This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary and we should be researching something better than this.               ",2

Venus once had oceans and was covered with structures like valleys and mountains that we have here on Earth. The risk is high, but the reward is even higher.

So all those years we studied mars and it's land's forms to see if there were others that look a like. We didn't find other that look a like so people start to make their own ideas of the face.

Most people though that was made for aliens, but it wasn't. We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.

NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not.

So we decided to show it to the world because it was just a mesa. People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc.

06c3953,"""Face"" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the ""truth"" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it says ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.

06c7026,"The Face on Mars is just a landmark. I can tell you this because you can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming.

You can't believe anybody that has no real evidence. In paragraph five it says that ""evidence that NASA would rather have."" That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential. People thing the face is evidence of life on Mars and the Face is bona fide so they are saying there has to be life on Mars. In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about. This is evidence of why you can't believe anything without true evidence.

NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that. This is evidence of why NASA won't leak anything so people do not know the truth.

If NASA won't leak anything then everyone is just assumimg. ""The Face on Mars has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" It has been in movies okay and they change it up a little bit to make it interesting and people think that is the true story. NASA wishes there was ancient civilization background on Mars so they know the full details. NASA doesn't even know the full story of the The Face, so how can people be for sure about anything. These are examples of why people are just assuming.

People think it is a face that aliens put on there. So you are saying if I go out to the middle of the desert and see a face it camre from aliens. It is a natural landmark that came with the planet of Mars. NASA is not even telling people so no one even knows for sure anyways.

You can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming. This is why this is just a landmark. There is a lot of landmarks on earth and this is one of them on Mars. There is no evidence of any of this so don't believe what everybody says.              ",3
06c7ba1,"Everyday technology is changing for the better. There is a lot of contriversy about cars. Wheather they should be driverless or not. I belive that it is not a good idea for the cars to be driverless. I think this becuase humans are smarter, technology fails sometimes, and it will be too expensive. The idea of cars being driverless is scary.

Firstly, I believe that humans are smarter than any computer in the world. Humans know what is going on whereas computers dont know as much. comeputers can fail to sense something and get in bad accidents. Drivers also have better senses, computer can always fail. I belive that humans should be the only ones driving the cars.

Another reason that i think cars should not be driverless, is becuase technology always fails. What if one of the sensors fail and you loose control of the car. The artilce said that the cars arn't fully driverless, so what is the point. Also, computars can glitch and cause horrible accidents. technonlgy is not very reliable.

lastly, another reason why cars shouldn't be driverless is becuase it would cost a a lot of money. Cars will have many sensors and devises that are very expensive. The roads will also need to have some senors in them and that will cost a fortune. the cars will also need a lot of energy to keep all the sensors running, which will mean that the battery will need to be changed constantly, and batterys arn't very cheap. I belive that it will cost to much money to make the driverless car.

In conclusion, I belive that driverless cars shouldn't be made. Driverless cars will cost toom much, humans are smarter, and technology is not reliable. Driverless cars will cause alot of debt and accidents. It is pointless to make them if the driver will always need to be there taking the wheel. So the cars are not completely driverless. Driverless cars are not a good idea.      ",3

This sentece is telling the reader the truth right then and there. The face infact is formed by a natural landform, a mesa which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 2 it tells us, the readers, that scientists figured the face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia but only had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. In paragraph 8 it gives a reasonn on why maybe the alien markings showed up on the face. The camera that took the photograph of the face had to peer through a wispy cloud to see the face. Perhaps the alien figures had been caused by the cloudy surface. In paragraph 6 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim was still trying to get the truth to the people after 18 years long of the Viking mission ended. Althoug targeting Cydonia was not easy, on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team from Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia flew and took a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos.

06cf397,"There are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage, like it will help lower green house gases, it will help save money, and its a great way to get exercise.

Don't get me wrong I love driving and all but it's effecting our ecosystem. Just think if one day out of every week we rode our bikes, or we car pooled, or we took the bus think of how much smog would go away. In source 2 it talks about how they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave there cars at home same went for odd-numbered licence plates the following day. With in five days sixty pecent of the smog was cleared. And they only did it for five days, imagine if every city in the world did this once a month. In source one it states that passenger cars are responsible fro twelve percent of green house gas emisssions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some parts of the United States. In source one it also talks about a city in Germany named Vauban. Vauban is a city that has banned cars. There is a main thoroughfare , where the tram runs to downtown Freiburg, and and a ffew streets on the edge of the community but ther e are only two places to park-large garadges on the outside of town. And it cost 40,000 dollars along witha home. If we had cities like this here in the U.S. it would be so much better and there wouldnt be so much pollution.

By limiting the usage on cars it will help save money. Think if you walked or rode you're bike to work everyday then you wouldnt have to pay for gas. Gas is tipically three to four dollars so if you wanted to put thirty gallons of gas in you car it could cost you ninety dollars. Thats a lot of money to spend on gas and thats not even a full tank for some people. Sure if you ride you bike to work everyday you might have to fix it but you're gonna have to fix your car at some point to and bike parts are so much cheaper than car parts so you'd be saving money there too. And if you walked you would'mt have to even worry about fixing your bike. It might take you longer to get to where you need to go but think you'll be saving money and the Earth. You don't even have to ride your bike or walk, you can car pool or take the bus. You still have to pay for the bus but its way cheaper than paying for gas.

If you're limiting your car usage and walking or riding your bike to work everyday, which maens you'll be getting exercise. Most people don't get the exercise they need so by limiting your car usage not only are you helping the environment you're getting the daily exercise you need. Even if you're riding the bus you're gonna have to get to the bus stop some how. And they even have a place to put your bike on the bus so if the bus does'tn take you all the way to where you need to go you can ride your bike the rest of the way.

So limiting your car usage is'nt all that bad. I mean I don't know anyone who does'nt want to help eliminate green house gases, save money and get exercise while doing it.    ",4

06d6248,"Would you want to be burned at 800 degrees Fahrenheit? No, that just sound to painful you might say. Scientists at NASA speculate that Venus's surface on the planet can average those temperatures. In this essay I will talk about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and evidence that backs my claim up thoroughly.

Going to another planet seems so dangerous and so far out of our mind that we don't think about this idea on a regular basis. The text states in paragraph 3, ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures avereage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouter on Earth."" This quote shows how much more dangerous Venus is than Earth just simply based on the atmosphere of the planet and that harsh conditions that cover it. Another piece of evidence is this in paragraph 4, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such asn valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of Venus seems indisputable."" This quote shows how Venus is so close geographically and distance wise to Earth based on some land features. Researchers find that getting even 30 miles from the surface of the planet the temperatures would still be at roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to Earth's sea level.

Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is so magnificant of a planet because we have never experienced a planet so much like our own. Our travels shouldn't be limited by dangers or doubts that we may have but should meet our endeavourous wonders and imagination of the planet and travel.    ",3

Plus candidates don't even spend their times in the places they know they would have no chance of focusing on the tight races in the states or in no chance of winning. The electoral college is practically unfair, outdated, and irrational. I mean the electoral college can have some good outcomes such as the non democratic method of selecting the president that would be overruled. When you're voting for an electoral college you're actually voting for a slate of electors. They usually avoid the problems of the elections in which none of the candidate gets a majority of the votes that are casted. In some states they know their votes will have no effects. The most thoughtful people that vote should be the ones that decide the election.

Electoral college are retained because of its lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative. Elections are only a few of voters away from catastrophe. In elections there could be ties, deadlocks, in Hawaii they had voted the other way. Their are many campaigns about 17 states didn't see the candidates at all including South Carolina, a lot of voters didn't get to see campaign ads. Some win the popular votes but lose the presidency. About 60 percent of the people prefer a direct election from what we have now.

Voters that are now in the presidential elections are people who want to express the political preferences rather than to have people who think single votes can decide an election. Winner-take-all method of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates. Some other things begin equal, a large state gets more attention from the presidential candidates in campaigns than a small state.                    ",2

Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

This is why we need you to be in our program have exiting adventures just like Luke Bomberberger did when he was an adult. You can have the fun to if you want to have unique visit to places. please come join us with this program and have your lifetime adventurre with all the food suplies, games, reading and more so, leave your stuff at home and, come have the fun and exiting trips, visit with our program.

Participate at the Seagoing Cowboy's program at anytime and everyday. Be like Luke Bomberberger when he claimed his life with experience and, adventures.   ",2
06e2db4,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

06ed983,"In the aricle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. Details I found from in the article show that computers can read a persons emotions. It can also tell from a painting or a video. It tells us in the beginging of the paragraph 1 that in the Mona Lisa paiting it shows emotion. According to the new computer software that can read emotions they tested it on paiting. She shows 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perecent ferful, and 2 percent angry.

I believe this new technology is valuable for our use. It can give us bettter ways to explore and to communicate with computers. It tells us in the artilcle that computers can actually ""calculate"" emotions. It can recognize how a human feels and how humans express themselves. A psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman a creator for FACS constructed a 3-D computer model of a face and all major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. One or more muscles that move is called a ""action unit"". An example, your pfrontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyues) raise your eyuebros when your surprised or shocked .

Using video imagery, the new emotion-regonition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. Humans perform this same impressice ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her or his face. I think to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom is impressive. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It could also make computer animated faces more clear and expressive for video games video surgery. But also most humans communicate in nonverbal, including emotional communicaton.

I think the use to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable. It can help them in the classroom if there confused or distracted. It could really help a lot more then just students in a classroom. I think it could be used around in daily life maybe at a hostpital or military. This is why i think the Facial Action Coding System and technology is valuable.            ",3
06ef6d4,"Many people think that the Face that was discovered on Mars might have been created by aliens. But thats far from the truth. There are many reasons why that face could have shown up there. A natural lanform maybe? Mesa? Anything but aliens.

Although there is no evidence for there being life on Mars, many skeptics say otherwise. We believe that is was just a natural lanform that was mistaken for looking like a face because the landform gives off the illusion of having eyes and a mouth. Its unusual shadow is believed to only be a mesa and many people are fascinated with it.

Some people counter will be you are hiding it because you dont think the people of the United States can handle it, or it can be too dangerous for us to comprehend. This all could be good reasons not to tell but, considering the fact that there was not evidence of life, how can there be some sort of alien? My rebuttal to these claims are it just had happened naturally and everything is going just going how it was made to be and NASA haf found positive and reasonable points that it was just made naturally.

We have different landforms made everyday and the come out looking rather unusual but that doesnt mean that there is anything out there that is capable of reaching us. If the skeptics are so sure that that was made with the possiblilities of there being aliens on Mars, then they need the statistic and evidence to support why.",3
06fa3b6,"Do you remember when the weather was mild with a slight breeze and you could go and just drive with the windows for about a year? Imagine be able to do that in a car that doesn't need your help to drive. Wouldn't it be nice to have that? I think it would and in the near future it might just be possible. They has been several motor compinies that are on tract to have a driverless model out in the year 2020.

The more you think about being able to absorb nature in a car the better it sounds. Think about driving around the Grand Canyon or taking a tour around Times Square in New York. Both seem like fun places to visit but when you are driving around rocks and trying to avoid clif edges or focusing on the traffic in front of you that may take an hour just to move one block, now that doesn't seem that enjoyable. Now in the future there is a possinbility that you could still do these things, still be in the drivers seat, but be able to look around and enjoy the sereny because your car drives itself.

Now you might be thinking that this is very dangerous and right now at this present moment it may be. However, with the way technology is advancing and the ability we have with it, driverless cars might be safer than cars driven by humans. Us humans have a tendency to always make mistakes and some of those mistakes cause injury and even death when we come to talk about motor vehicle mistakes. There has been plenty of fatal accidents casued by people not paying attetion or drinking and then trying to drive drunk which is one the stupidest mistakes someone could make in their lifetime. With the driverless car these mistakes can easily be prevented. No more do we have to not only focus on the road in front of ourselves but also to the area around us because the majority of driving is defense driving and watching out for other people. WIth these cars you don't have to worry about weather the car next to you is going to try to cut you off or if the person heading the opposite direction is going to veer off and speed into your lane. All of these cars have sensors and can detect what is around them, where they are going, when to stop, and when to go.

These cars are the cars of the future. They will be installed with the best and latest safety equipment. They will change the way of our everyday life. They will change the way we travel. These cars are coming and coming fast, they maybe be expensive at first but it won't take long before everyone has them. They may seem like a tale from a movie or a book, but they will be here before you know it , weather you are ready or not.",3
070faae,"Technology is a great thing to have in a classroom. It helps kids in many ways. It helps being able to know when a kid is struggling and the computer can go back and help the kid. The computer can do many different things. It could help with their homework. Being able to use a computer is a nice thing to have especially in the classroom, because a teacher isn't always going to be there for the child that has a question. Technology could be very productive too. Most kids like being able to use technology instead of pencil and paper. Kids engage more when they use computers.

Technology is a great resource is the classroom to have because it is hard for kids to pay attention. If you have a computer software that could recognize emotions it would help with what you need to help the kid with more. All the computer would have to do is be able to have a wide understanding of subtle facial movements with a 3-D computer model of the face. The software would have an understanding of all the 44 major muscles in the model that would need to move like the way the muscles do in a human face.

I'm very supportive with technology being used in the classroom, because if a kid cannot write it could potentially be easier for a kid if he were to type it. If a child were to have trouble than it would pick up on it from the child's facial reaction. In Paragraph six it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomeing confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It could be more beneficial than a teacher, because for the kids who do understand it they can move onto other things and the kids who don't can have extra help.

Most humans show facial expressions toward someone instead of verbal communication. Paragraph six Dr. Huang said that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" Most people could have a benefit to this so that they could understand the assignment they're assigned for the lab they could be doing for a science class. It just all depends on whether or not the kid would use this tool effectivly as others. It could be used as a lie detector in a way if it picks up any facial expressions.

This facial recognition can be very benefital for the kids who struggle on watching a video over how to do something. The 3-D will calculate the kids who are struggling with a problem or anything that is assigned to them. This strategy is very useful for when kids don't have any help or when the teacher is helping someone else it can help and walk the kid through the problem instead of having them get upset, because the computer can detect anything that happens to the kid while in the process of the lesson. Technology is a very useful thing for kids who struggle, become upset, or have trouble understanding.",3

07122f0,"There are many different plants in our solar system. You may have a favorite one or maybe you're just not that interested in it. Well have you ever thought about taking a trip to the moon or just the planet period maybe even studying a planet just for fun? It will cause you to think about the 5 w's first the who, who will be there are there lots of humans just floating around in space? what will it be like, what would it look like? Why did someone create this?

when did everything take place? Why did it take place? Where did everything all begin And what made someone think of this ?

Let's say you studied Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planted in our solar system. It could be by far the most exiciting plant that you could ever study and the greatest dangerous one too. Beyond high pressure and heat Venus geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Venus causes many things to corrupt without venus there would be many corruptions in the world. But so does any other planet right? Not every planet is a good planet.

How is Venus tested and when was it discorved ? According to the text,"" Many astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planted in our solar system"" The text also states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. "" Different plantes have been here for over 1,000 years crazy right, If you was to imagine what life would be like with out planets or gravity keeping everything in check what would we be up to right now. We need these things to survive.

Venus could be the most by far dangerous planet to visit the text says ,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". The text also states that, "" On the plantet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This goes to show that if you were able to take a trip to Venus you probaly would pass out or either die because the tempature is not average compared to the Earth's and there's less oxygen.

You might take it into concederation that we should not be limited to on things we want to do just because the danger of things, and I agree because the world be so much better if we did what we wanted. Studying a planet and actually going to see about it could be someone's biggest dream but they are stopped by it because of the outcome. Many people say chase your dream but how if we stuck in the same mind frame as everyone else.      ",2
0719241,"I will be writing about why you should paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will include details from the story. Also reasons to join the program. the last thing i will include is examples from the text.

My frist reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is just to experiance new things. You should not be on your phone all day doing nothing. Get up and at least try to have a little bit of fun. if you have never been there or even heard of it how do you know it is going to be boring. You never know until you drop your phone and actually join. You might end up having some fun.

A second reason is well look what Luke Bomberger did. He joined 44 nations to form unrra (the united nations relief and rehabilitation). UNRRA took care of horses, young cows, and mules that wers shipped overseas. Wouldnt you want to spend your days with nice and loving animal that wont hurt you. You never know, if no one joins Seagoing Cowboys then maybe there could have been animals who were in dangered, or might be extinct. I think that animal are really fun to hang out with.

The last and final reason is you dont just take care of animals but you help the places that were dastroyed because of world war II. It would be great if you actually got to see where many people were fighting, got killed, injured, or much more in world war II. Just like Luke in the story, you can also go to may places that he went like new orleans, or greece. This is your oppertunity to visit beautiful places that you have never been to before. You could also meet new people.

To summarize everything up those are some reasons why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. You just never know until you try it out.   ",3

And on the planet;s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

These facts that you can research are very true because you could go up there and find out all theses stuff and these facts support my claim because you can research cool stuff about Venus and that other people didn't know about and thats how it supports my claim.

071de41,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" a technology called Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies. This would allow people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another. Being able to know how someone feels helps to complement those emotions. If a classmate was feeling happy, sad, angry, or any other emotion, and it was known it would be much easier to know how to approach them than it would be without the knowledge showing why this infromation could be valuable.

Knowing how another person feels makes it less difficult to communicate with them and communication is important in a classroom. In the text the author talked about how the program could tell when a person is not truly conveying emotions.

The text says,""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

This information is useful to a classroom because it shows the true emotions or feelings of someone. If a student in a classroom said ""I understand"", but did not truely mean it a teacher could use this information to know that more teaching may have to be done for students to fully understand the topic being taught.

Another example from the text says,""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This quote from the text explains that there are many different ways to express emotion and because of this it may be harder for everyone to fully understand how someone feels based on facial expression. That is why this technology could be valuable so that everyone is fully understood and proper treatment can be given to complement emotions.

Things should change in a classroom when students feel unconnected to what is going on, but it is not easy for everyone to know just when students may feel out of place. A quote from the text says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Here in the text the article talks about the technology being able to tell when a student is bored and confused, and then being able to modify a lesson effectively.

With this technology students would gain a full understanding of a topic without needing to ask because of facial expressions. This would be very effective in a classroom as it makes sure that everyone gets to learn the way that they need to.

The text also says,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too."" This quote explains that not all communication is verbal and most is actually nonverbal.

This means that listening may not always be enough and it is important to see and feel how others feel proving why this technology can help a classroom.

By reading faces the technology can help convey one's feelings to another to help gain a full understanding.

By understanding how someone else feels it makes it easier to understand them.

The article says,""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

This quote talks about empathy and how it is important in knowing how to treat people. Using this in a classroom could helpl classmates and teachers get along better.

The use of facial recognition technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies.

This helps people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another.

0728321,"The Aliens on Mars

In the text Unmasking the Face on Mars NASA says that there was a face.Then they went back eighteen years later.Then another three years and said it was a natural landform.I also think that it is a natural landform because there isn't really aliens or anything other living thing on mars.Some people would there are lifeforms on Mars because of water which is ridiculous.There could be clouds and water on a planet without a lifeform. In these next few paragraphs i will tell you why it is a natural landform.

One reason that the so called face is only a landform is because it could've been a rock formation.There could be rocks in the shape of a head because of other rocks and erosion.And how the got the eyes?...shadows.Shadows could've been a be part of this because its a planet pretty close to the sun.So from which way the Viking 1 was facing there could've been shadows.

Second reason is on April 5,1998 when they went to mars again with Mars Global Surveyor...while thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting the image JPL wedsite revealed it as a natural landform. People were upset so they said since it was a cloudy haze there could still be a face.Which made it worse because people actually believed that.

Third reason is if there was a face form on earth and no one would freak out by it because there is actual humans on earth.So if there were aliens everyone would freak.Am I right?So if there were real aliens you wouldnt know what they actually look like but you do know from evidence from ""actual pictures"" that people supposedly took.

Some people think its the other way around.Some people who aren't like me actually believe in aliens.They think since in 2001 they sent a better camera on a ""cloudless"" day that there were Martians.And since they have the camera whith better pixels they could see more clearly...so clearly that you could've have seen Egyptian style pyramids or even a small shack which was almost impossible in the Viking 1.

To conclude, I think that the face was a natural landform made by erosion.It would most likely to be impossible for it to be a martian, not saying it is but I highly doubt there would be martians.",4
072c8a3,"I think that it is a neat idea to have driverless cars but only if all of the things that could go wrong have been evaluated. I can also tell you that they will never work out everything that could go wrong no matter how much they think they have. What if there is a malfunction and the car swerves and drives off of a cliff. That wouldn't be the drivers fault it would be caused by faulty technology. There would have been nothing that the driver of the vehicle could have done to prevent that from happening. What happens if one of these cars runs into another car because the technology stopped working. As stated in the passage would it be the drivers fault or the manufacturer.

You have to keep all of these things that could go wrong in mind you can't just think about the upsides of these smart cars. It would be neat to have a car drive for you i'll admit that and that is amazing that we're working on something that can do that and that we have became that technologically developed. There is just many things that need to be taken into consideration. There are so many ways someone could get hurt in something like this smart car. I think it would just be safer to not have these type of cars out and about on the street. What if they malfunctioned and ran a pedestrian over and neither the person in the car or the pedestrian walking would have seen it coming. There are already so many people being killed by drunk drivers now a days. I think achieving the development of this kind of technology would just make the death rate go up and this world doesn't need that happening it is already heart breaking how many people die in a day already.

People should not have to dread walking around if they do not have a vehicle just because they fear of this technology hitting them. They would have to take the necessary precautions in order to have this kind of technology on the streets. I don't think that the developers think of all the dangerous things that could happen by having these cars. They all just think of how cool it would be to drive a smart car. Well I can tell you that I think that to many people die from drunk drivers or people that aren't paying attention to where they are going when they are driving around. Yeah were still going to have people die from these things. We don't however need there to be more people dying because of faulty technology.

They can think that they have worked every kink out in their technology but, I can assure you that they haven't. There is always going to be a risk of something happening with this kind of technology. It's not just safe because the manufacturers say that it's safe that is just not how it works. All i'm saying is that we should be more concerned with what could go wrong than what is cool. I would rather be safe walking on a sidewalk then not wanting to leave because im scared of dying. I think that we just need to stop being lazy it's just steering a steering wheel it's not rocket science.",3

073d5b0,"""New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others."" I believe that this software is very interesting because it detects your facial expressions through a screen and tries to understand your emotions. However, I do not think that we need this software in our schools for education purposes.

There are a few reasons in which I believe that these programs should not be installed on our school computers. The text claims that ""the computer could modify a lesson, like a human instructor.""

However, I find this hard to believe considering the software can not specifically determine what lessons or problems you do not understand. One for instance, if a student is supposedly confused or bored, he or she can ask the teacher for help. If we have a school computer that modifies and changes the lesson due to facial expressions, it might get in the way and misunderstand what we actually need help with or slow us down. Recieving specific help from teachers, to understand the certain steps that a student struggles with would be a better option in my opinion.

Secondly, we do not know how accurate this software is. The program could be very touchy; It could mix up confusion for anger. The student could be upset about a different topic or could simply have a certain resting face. The accuracy could have a lot to do with how this program would help us.

Lastly, Why spend a lot of money installing programs to hundreds of computers at our school when we can recieve help from our teachers?

Teachers are there to answer specific questions and a software that only detects your facial expressions and matches them to emotions can not do that. Installing these programs to our school computers will cost the school a lot of time and money without knowing for a fact that this software will actually be useful. Given these ideas, I do not think that it would be a very helpful addition to our students to install this software.                           ",4
0742654,"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.    ",2
0746d1a,"There are some good and bad examples in this article. It is a easy side to choose weather you want to agree or disagree with the development of theses cars. The side I would have too choose is not to agree with the development of these cars.

I would have to disagree because if i'm driving down the road and the car stops working because of an accident that happened. Who's fault is it? Like the article said, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the maufacture?"" If it is the cars fault, the driver would be aloud to sue for the faulty of the car. If it was the drivers fault, then they would have to pay for the damage they have caused.

What would happen if the sensors in the car stop working, in the middle of the person driving? Let's say you're driving down the road, the car in front of you slams on their breaks because of a read light. Your car can't stop because of the sensors are not working, you can't take control because the car has control to stop you. You skid down the road, hitting the other car. What happens next?

In conclusion, before they start selling these cars, they could at least take more time fixing the things that go wrong. Would you want to have something go wrong with the car, then it be your fault? They could try something new if they can't seem to fix the problem. Or maybe they should just stop trying to take away some of the driving privliges from the customers. This is not a good idea for the future. It could go wrong in so many ways.",2

Many people would not want a computer looking at them to see their facial expression to determine what they like or what they dislike. Many people can often pull of a fake expression that is good enough for a computer to calculate, like in paragraph seven, which includes instructions on how to do a real smile compared to a fake smile.

Most people cover up cameras on their laptops,computers, and phones for privacy and safety. Anyone who would cover up their camera would most likely not want their face constantly being scanned to tell emotion or what they like and dislike.

In paragragh seven, the article briefly explains how to look happy, which anyone can do to fool an emotion scanner. Computers are often accurate, but only do what is coded and not anything else. If you were to always be happy but not look happy, the Facial Action Coding System would not be something useful for you or students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System can have many flaws in its design and would not be useful for students in a classroom. It may be innaccurate and not scan correctly or not be used at all for safety and privacy. there are many ways that the Facial Actions Coding System would not be useful and would not help students learn, just show how they feel about some things like websutes and ads.",3
074b43d,"Would you want to keep the Electoral College or change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States? I would want to keep the Electoral College. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, it helps people vote, and it helps people out. If i were you id pick to keep the Electoral College. So let me tell you why you should pick to keep the Electoral College.

First of all, you should pick the Electoral College because it keeps the process organized. If you didnt have the Electoral College than you'd probably be confused about a lot of things. You wouldnt know where to go to vote. Also you probably wouldnt know where the section of the electors is. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. If you didnt have the Electoral College you wouldnt know anything of that, so pick to keep the Electoral College.

Second of all, you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it helps people vote. If it wasnt for electors you probably wouldnt be picking a President or none of that because the electors set it all up. The Electoral College tells you where the meeting is to vote. The Electoral College has 538 electors and there has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect a president. So there is no reason not to pick to keep the Electoral College.

Third of all, it helps people out. It helps people out by telling them what to do, where to go, and who to vote for. If there wasnt an Electoral College it would be harder to vote. If its in the Constitution that means it will help you. The Founding Fathers put it there for a reason. So if i were you id pick the Electoral Collge i wouldnt pick to change the election by popular votes for the president of the United States.

Last but not least, I think you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, it helps people vote, and it helps people out. Why would you pick to change the election by popular votes? What good is gonna happen? Nothing. It would be better to pick to keep the Electoral College. So you should without a doubt pick the Electoral College.    ",3

They headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece which ment he could be drafted for military service. By the time Luke was discharge in 1947,Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.Helping out on his aunt's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, not the dangers at sea. Luke also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboy played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals were house. Table -tennis tournament, fencing, boxing, reading, whillting, and games also helped pass the time.

074fd98,"Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. They are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting from your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost non-exsistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars from the road is by removing parkig lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting from one place to another will require another means fr transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the enviorment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power.

The cars use half of the fuel of today's taxis. It's told that the cars have drivin more than half a million miles without even crashing. The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars by your position on driverless cars.

Reading this article i'm not sure if i'm against it of not. Things that

ran through my head when they asked,"" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore"". Well the thing that I thought about were like Why? I dont really see the purpose of these cars at all. I mean yes, it would be nice from people bussiness people that have to drive thousands of miles each day. For the people just living and normal life like driving to the store or to a friends house, I dont see why they would need them. Is it really as safe as they say it is? Now as I think about the driverless cars more and more, I think i'm going to say that I am against the driverless cars.

I would understand why people would be for the driverless cars. They won't have to drive their kids everywhere, They won't need to worry about drinking and driving, and they won't have to worry about falling asleep while driving. Yes, those are all good resons but they should know already not to do that stuff. I think it's just a way for people to become more and more lazier each day.

0760842,"Many people think or believe that they should get rid of the Electoral College vote for the president. Well in my opinion I believe they should not keep it because why do we even need them for? We have the people of the US. They can vote for a president, that's why the Constitution was written, to gives us the rights, freedom of speech, the right to vote. Why else would we have that if our vote won't really matter.

They should get rid of the Electoral College Vote because we already have many people voting for the president. We don't really need many people just to choose one man or woman to lead the country. They can just count how many citizens voted for a president and the one who has more voters is the winner. If it ends up as a tie, then just let the memebers of the House of Represenatives vote. Or at least let the popular vote decide who the president will be.

Having the Electoral College vote is useless, because they just vote for a for a slate of electors, who in turn will elect the president. It just adds more steps to elect the president. They should just get rid of it and keep the popular vote for the president of the United States. Let the qualified citizens vote who they want to be the president. It'd make more sense, because they just vote for someone who is not holding office,  anyone. I say get rid of it so that we don't get a ""disaster factor"" anymore. That 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century.  This electoral college vote is unfair , outdated, and irrational. its unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

However, many people may disagree. They belive that we should keep the electoral college vote. There's five reasons of why they think we should keep this type of method of choosing the President. The first reason is the certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to happen than a dispute over the popular vote. The second reason is everyone's president. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal and no region has enough electoral votes to elect for a president.  The third reason is the swing states. The unfair method of winner-takes-all electoral votes induces the candidates and focuses on the voters in toss-up states whom more likely pay close attention to the campaign. The fourth reason is the big states. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by letting a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. And the fifth reason is to avoid run-off elections. It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

So in conclusion they should get rid of the electoral college vote because its unfair to the small states. Knowing that their vote will not have any effect, they have no reason to pay attention to the campaign. They can just let the popular vote decide or the House of Representatives. Bob Dole was right. Lets get rid of the electoral college vote. Mostly get rid of it because its unfair to some states or people. Its is really an irrational way to settle on an agreement of who the president may be. And yes is may have less disputes over the outcome but it better to have some dispurtes over it so we elect the correct president and see what all their qualities may be. In my opinion I believe we should abolish the electoral college.                                         ",3

Driverless cars will cause a panic. We will never be certain if the car is functioning correctly and will doubt whether we are safe or not. How can we be so sure the car will not malfuntion and crash? Thats the thing, we cant be sure and will always be doubtful of what may happen. In passage 7 it states "" But all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" By telling us this it is saying that the car is still unable to do all task that a normal human can do

The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. By using driverless cars as a taxi system, gas consumption would majorly decrease. The taxi system idea could also lead to new ways of public transportation. These cars could take their passengers anywhere they needed to go through a direct route. Passengers would no longer have to wait for long periods of time on buses for their stops. These driverless systems would allow for greater flexibility overall.

Driverless cars would also help communities everywhere with safety. Since these smart cars are loaded with sensor technology, they can help limit the amount of crashes that were regularly happening. The protypes of driverless cars have gone millions of miles without crashes and could help stunt the commonality of vehicular crashes and deaths. Driverless cars could also aide with the safety for learning and elderly drivers. Oftentimes, teenage drivers and drivers with slow reaction times are the causes of accidents that could have been avoided with easy assistance. Smart, semi-driverless cars could be the answer to these costly problems.

0767c85,"In my opinion, the Electoral College is not an appropriate respresentation of the people's opinions. It is true that the popular vote determines the representative, but that does not mean that all citizen's views are expressed. Many citizens have stopped voting because of the ignorance that is the Electoral College. One should not vote for someone they do not know to represent their lives in the federal government.

The Electoral College might be the easiest way to contract a solid vote from American citizens, but laziness is definitely not efficient. If we want our country running smoothly and in a way that every citizen is comfortable with, everyone needs to be represented. Many citizens will start voting when they hear that they wont be pummelled with propaganda about politicians who think they know about what the people want. They will be elated to hear that they will actually be heard. They will actually make a difference in their country. The common people must be represented, not just advertisements. The conflict between upper and lower class will end because both will be able to make a difference in the minimum wages and tax increases.

Changing the election process to the popular vote would not only represent all people, but cut out the extremes. All politicians must say whether they are a Democrat or a Republican. With popular vote, we can go in depth to what the people really want. Like how gun restraints only go to an extent, so should the poeple's views. Most citizens aren't completely Republican or completely Democratic, and that's alright. There are the conditions in between that need to be addressed.

Coming from a centrally liberal family, I think that all elections through the Electoral College are hoaxes. The representatives of the College and even the president are picked a long time beforehand. The government wants to brainwash the citizens to slowly turn us onto their side. Even if the government rigs the votes but says that the result is completely dependant on the people, it will still belate citizens and get them to participate more in the voting process.    ",3

A seagoing cowboy is someone who takes care of animals that are shipped over sea. Then brings them to the people that need help since the war ruined their food supply or cattle.

It is kinda hard to care for the animals but its not to much of a challenge. I used to help out on my aunts farm all the time and that gave me some experience. It also is a little disgusting to clean the stalls the first time but I pulled through it and eventually I got used to it. My favorite part has to be traveling when i get some free time its fun to go sight seeing.

As a seagoing cowboy you go all around the world and visit amazing places but there are sad moments aswell. When I found out that people other than me are being affected by the war and some are suffering worse, that opened up my eyes. I thought to myself thats why I joined the seagoing cowboys after all not just because I wanted to see the world but also to help people in need.

Lastly being a seagoing cowboy isnt just an adventure its much more. Its part of our future. We need to help everyone in the world through this hard time. Being a seagoing cowboy will help do that. Please consider the offer and sign up.                      ",3
0778075,"Have you ever thought what venus could actually do and what it contains good or bad effects? Well acccording to the article there is various reasons why it can be worthy despite the dangers it presents. Venus is sometimes refered to as the evening star it is one of the brightess points of light in the dark sky. It is also the second planet from our sun. In the article it says that "" venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth"". It is still good to study it though so you can know more information about it

Altough venus may seem to be good it can present different types of dangers. In paragraph three the first sentence it says that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus"". This isnt good it makes the conditions bad and this is something that the humans never encountered before on earth. This could have bad results such as an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustimed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans nad it says it could also liquefy many metals.

Learning and knowing about venus is important so you not only you know about it but what it also contains the pros and cons. Knowing the value of it and what it conatins is important.

In conclusion, is why these reasons is important to know about Venus.You can know about whats happening and if something occurs you now know why. Venus has its own value and ""human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.    ",2
077acd9,"Do you think that there are advantages to limiting car usage? Yes, I do think that there are advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution. There are many advantages of having limited car usage. This includes many different transportations and because of car culture.

To begin with, there are advantages to limited car usage because of pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog, the smog rivale Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gas. Diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines. Paris has more smog than other European capitals.

To continue, there are advantages to limited car usage because of many different acts of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia a program is set to spread to other countries. It was called a ""Car Free"" day which meant that you could not use your car for a whole day. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the  streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

Furthermore, there are advantages to limited car usage because of Car Culture. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions is to shift in American behavior. Research studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States has long been one of the world's prime car cultures. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" says Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation

Research Institute. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.

In conclusion, there are many different advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution, many different acts of transportation, and because of Car Culture.               ",3
077cf8e,"What are your thoughts on the face? Well I think that it was created by aliens. How is that even possible, how can you belive that the face was created by aliens. Well how could you possibly think that it is a humans face, thats impossible. When the team snapped a picture ten times more clear than the original Viking photos, and

When NASA posted the picture on a website, it revealed that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, also proving that it was not an alien monument in the first place.

But still after proving that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, still not everybody was satisfied. Some people still think that since it was cloudy at that time of the year, the camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy, white, and fluffy clouds to be able to see the face. Skeptics were still saying, ""Perhaps the alien marking were conseled by the wispy clouds.

NASA decided to go back to Mars on April 8, 2001, MGS came close enough to get a second look. The team captured an extraodinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resoultion.

I will also be able to tell you how well the author supports his idea. Which is by, out of all the other paragraphs, he is actually writing all the main ideas and supporting his claim and idea in this whole artical. Also in paragraph 5 it says, ""The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". Also in paragraph 3 it says, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". Plus, in paragraph 4 it states that (or askes that), ""If our sister planet is so in hospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface?"". In paragraph 1 it states that, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Venus,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple to evem an amature stragazer to spot'. Noe in paragraphn 2 it says that, ""Often reffered to as earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" So now in paragraph 6, it states that ""However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safley far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rending standards forms of photography amd videography ineffective."" Plus, in paragraph 7 it states that, ""NASA is working on other aprroaches to studing Venus.""

078120d,"The author makes a very strong statement when he says we should explore Venus. The author finds the exploration to be worthy of NASAs time. As dangerous as it may be, exploring Venus would determine whether or not it could be a new home for the human race and all other sources of life. It would be a significant breakthrough for survival.

When the author says that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, it sounds like Venus should be our next home. It is not that easy as the author exlplains. Many times NASA has sent spacecrafts to Venus to see what it had to offer. Most crafts became worthless after a short period of time on the planet. Not one spacecraft has landed on Venus in over thirty years. Zero research was able to be done due to the extremes of the planet.

The planet Venus is closer to the sun than Earth resulting in extreme temperatures around 800 degrees on the outer crust of the planet. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide cover Venus along with clouds made of sulfuric acid. The atmospheric pressure is also an insane extreme scaling in around ninety times that of Earth. Volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning are all challenges that come along with Venus as well.

NASA has figured out ideas to send a man to study Venus. Though he would be floating 30 miles up from the surface, we would gather more information than we have at the time. MASA is also trying to engineer a spacecraft that will be able to land on the plnaet and last as long as they need or want.

Overall the author shows the strive to gather information on Venus and how it is setting us further in the future than never before. Venus is very dangerous indeed but new ideas and theories are being made everyday trying to conquer what Venus has brought to the table. The author summarizes this as, ""Our travels on Earth any beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",4
07845e1,"What do you think the face on Mars is? A natural landform or made by aliens? Most people think the so called ""Face on Mars"" is formed by aliens. I believe otherwise because, landforms on Earth are like that and these assumptions are made by conspircy theorist not by NASA officals. now here are my reasons.

The face on Mars is made by natural landforms and not by aliens. One thing of evience by a picture by Mars Global Surveyor, in paragraph 7 it says ""...anxious web surfers we're waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" That's a big piece of evidence that it's not made by aliens. Also, my second piece of evience that supports that the face on Mars is not made by aliens in paragraph 12 is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the Amerian West"". ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That's my first reason I believe that the face on Mars is landform made.

The fact that conspriacy theorist make the assumption of the face on Mars is made by aliens. You have to understand that those remakes are not all true they are just theories which is just provided by evience but, not always right. In paragraph 5 it says ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of like on Mars-evidencd that NASA woud rather hide, say conspiracy theroists."" ""meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" That evidence was never what NASA said that's conpiracy theorist said and it's not true. So, mark these words and think about your decision, i think you should change you're mind about the alien theory to a natural landform with this information.

The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" from the evidence is that it's a landfrom instead of aliens making these faces on Mars. Don't always go by what the internet or media says, go by what real experts say. Maybe, you people that think that it's made by aliens I hope my reasonings and evidence is strong enough to change you're mind. Now what do you think of my evidence did it change your mind?             ",4

Driverless cars can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. What if you have a baby in the car, or perhaps a pregnant woman in labor? These features can help the driver get tasks done while in the car, and still be moving safely as well.

People may ask what if you get bored and fall asleep since your not driving? All models of driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads-up displays. Also GM has devoped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedrstrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acheived with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written to the asumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. But new laws will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident. If something fails and someone is injures, is it the diver or the manufacturers fault?

Driverless cars are coming into a positive postiton. They can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. That can help drivers at anytime when they are occupying the vehicle. All models are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. The key to a truley driverless car is ahead of us, be we are getting closer, and closer to the destination every day.       ",4

Taking the thought of using this tec. in schools may be able to save lives of children who are feeling depressed sensing the emotions in one and alerting a counsaler or another profetinal to help the child befor the begin to have thoughts of suiside or worse.

Not to mention this tec. could be used in testing or regular class rooms and a way to see if a child is strugoling to pass a test or do there normal work alerting a teacher for help.

Now this may seem unfair to the children cuz some may not want the help but them knowing they will have someone there will make them feel better making them more relaxed and ready to do there work without stress.

This tec. can also be used for security in schools detecting hints of nervas or anctios children with melevolent intent sensing there emotions of there action may be the one way to lower the risk of attacks apon school around the world.

078c66d,"With the advancement in technology in the world we live in today, there should be no surprise of a car with the capabilities to drive itself. Though it does give technology yet another human job, driverless cars should be manufactored. I do not believe they should be maufactored for the average person though. Driverless cars should be manufactored for the blind, elderly, or anybody who does not have the driving capabilities that most have.

Driverless cars should be manufactored for the elderly. Very few people above the age of 70 have the driving capabilites and safety they once did when they were younger. For this reason, a driverless car would be ideal and safe for them to use for transportation. The driverless car would be a safe and effective transportation method for the elderly, this is one reason why driverless car should be manufactored.

Another reason the driverless car should be manufactored is how it will help the fight against drunk driving. With the computer at the wheel, and not the drunk driver, this could prevent from an accident or even a death. Though they could take control of the wheel, the computer system could be capable of recognizing such danger with the sensors, and take over for safety. The driverless car would be good to develop so that it could help in the fight against drunk drivers and other intoxicated drivers.

My final reason that the driverless car should be developed is so that the handicapped could have an easier time with transportation. The blind, the wounded, and the deaf all have their diffuculties with transportation. With the advancement in technology and cars, this would make it easier for them to get from one place to another. With the technology driving for them, they won't have to worry about there disability affecting them. With a safe driverless car developed, the handicapped community would get a better way of transportation.

In conclusion, technology is not always meant for fun. When the technology can greatly improve the life of the eldery or handicapped, it should be developed or used. When the technology can keep other drivers on the road safe from intoxicated driving, it should be developed and used. The driverless car can do all of the above, which is why it should be developed and used.     ",4
078f997,"Many people and other scientists believe that the Face was created by aliens. But, I definitely disagree. First, the Face may be shaped like an actual human being's face, but it's not an actual human being face. Clearly, there's sufficient evidence to prove the Face was not created by aliens. For example, there aren't any alien monuments, and there aren't any aliens! Pictures were taken ten times, to make sure that we got clear vision of the face. Even when picture of the Face appeared on the JPL web site, some people and other scientists, thought the Face looked like a natural landform. That's because a a shadow figure kind of looks like a human face, that doesn't mean it's an actual human. Also, never have I ever seen an alien. Contrary to popular opinion, aliens don't even exist. That's almost saying the aliens are going to take over the world.

Then, I have never heard of aliens creating the Face, knowing aliens creating anything else.

The face is a natural landform because it's just a shadow. Before, when Nasa's viking ship took pictures of the shadow, their camera could have had a bad angle and probably tried to make the shadow look like a real human face.

Next, never have I have heard of a viking ship capturing pictures of any aliens. Or, have I never of anyone capturing pictures of any aliens creating the Face.

In conclusion, I still think that the Face is a human landform because, once again, there aren't any aliens. Also, there aren't any alien monuments. I think everybody is just exageratting about the whole thing. Also, people could just be freaked out about what they had heard. Some could agree with me, or some couldn't. But this is what I believe in, and I'm sticking to it.    ",3
0792205,"Dear State Senator,

I think that the Electoral College is important becase it is  a process. The founding fathers established the Eletoral College to the Constitution as a comromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualificatied citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors.

The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. The counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. The mjority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District  of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ''state'' also refers to the District of Columbia.

The presidential elction is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in

November. One thing that I didn't know is that most states have a ""winner-take-all.""A ""winner-take-all"" is a system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate.    ",1
07952db,"Driverless cars should be developed in the future. Driverless cars could be able to do many things, and could change the world. They would only use half the fuel of today's taxis, offer more flexibity than a bus, and would be much easier for drivers also more enjoyable.

Driverless cars would be much easier for drivers in many ways. Drivers would not have to steer, accelertate, or brake their car, the car would do all of those things on its own. The driver would not have to do any work, unless the car notify the driver when the road requires human skills.

Having an driverless car would create an fun or more enjoyable time while driving. Even though the driver would stil have to watch the road, the driver would enjoy being able to relax in the car without having to drive.

The driver would not get bored, and would be often entertained because, the car would have in-car entertainment and information system. The in-car entertainment and information systems would also be safe because it would use heads-up displays that would turn off when the driver needs to take over.

By having an driverless car, you would not have to spend as much money on fuel because the car would only use half the fuel of todays taxis. I think that is a big improvement because you would not have to worry about having gas because it would not use as much. Also since the car offers more flexibility, you would be able to have more room, and do more things.

In conclusion, driverless cars could improve the world. Driverless cars should be developed in the near future. By having driverless cars, people would save money on gas, it would offer more flexibility, and also be more enjoyable.             ",3

079b107,"Some of the advantages of limiting car usage is definitely that it would help not polute the air. With so many people driving cars in small towns that can quickly polute the air, especially in paris in source two where it says ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partail driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" With all of that pollution it can cause things such as global warming, and unhealthy air for our bodies. With just a small break of not driving the congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Also with cold nights and warm days that also causes air to trap car emissions.

Another advantage of not driving cars, would be exercise. That would be such a good work out because you would have no other option except to walk/ride your bikes. You would get to socialize with everyone else who is walking to their jobs, or the grocerey store all while getting a little bit of exercise with your family. With everyone walking and having nothing better to do, sports centers and parks activity has bloomed throughough the city, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up with sales.

More and more people have stopped getting cars/licenses and instead taking the city bus, walking or riding their bike. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If more people would continue to either car pool or find a different way to get where they're going the worlds pollution would definitely begin to go down. Without all of the pollution that comes out of cars and that gets trap into the air, our air would begin to get so much more cleaner and safer for us to breathe.

With all of the money it takes to repair the roads, and the electricity it takes to run all of the stop lights, that money could go towards other things if people didnt drive as much as they do. Although many people need and use their cars for transportation theres always other ways to getting around town. It would also help save you money that is spent on gas every week, with the gas prices being unpredicatable every day.

With all of these advantages of not driving cars as much or at all, it would really help protect the worlds air, and could be a great source of exercise! Walking or riding your bike to wherever you need to go, or even just taking the city bus for two dollars. Also saving your money and spendind it on something else rather than wasting it on gas, or getting your car fixed. Or simply even buying a car, which can cost thousands of dollars.    ",4
079e8bb,"You're living the high life. You have a Driverless Car. What could go wrong? A lot can go wrong. Technology is a grand thing, but it's also a power. If we let it keep accumulating like this we could be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We can't let technology over rule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless cars. Soon cars will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In todays world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let cars start driving themselves we could get laszy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless cars on the rise this could get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the car didn't do what it was suppose to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of qestions and concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This is good. Their are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most cases. They know how to take control.

The practice of driveless cars are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They care about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are cars that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car is a smart car. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assitance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to rememeber who exactly is in charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore. We will be living in technologies world; not the world we worked so hard to build. This is why we need not let driveless cars come in to existance.           ",3
07a14a5,"The author's claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is closely related to Earth, Venus has a enviroment that is similar to Earth, and scientists want to explore more of what Venus has to offer.

The first claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus is closely related to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars our other planetary neighbors orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous to land on this cloud draped world. Each precious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us"" (Paragraph 2). This supports the author's claim because the author believes that scientists should study Venus because Venus is closely related to Earth.

The second claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus has a similar enviroment to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (Paragraph 3). This supports the author's claim because there are many physical and enviromental dangers that are present on Venus. Despite all of Venus's dangers, scientists still want to explore Venus in depth.

The third claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that the author supports the further exploration of Venus by scientists. In the passage it states,"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option to visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?. NASA has one particulary conpelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vechile hovering over Venus would aviod the unfrendily ground conditions by staying up and out of thier way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy, conditions, but survivable for humans."" (Paragraph 4 and 5). This supports the author's claim because scientists want to know more about Venus's planatery history and similarities to Earth.This statement also supports the author's claim because the scientists wants to try and send humans to Venus.

Therefore, the author's claim supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by Venus being closely related to Earth, Venus has a similar enviorment to Earth, and the author encouriging further explorations to Venus.       ",6

There would not be any traffic jams,or heavy smog,people wont have to worry about gas prices. Our enviroment would be cleaner and better for us to live in. There are so many advantages from limiting car usage.

People with cars tend to worry about gas prices and how much money it takes to fill up their car. When limiting the usage of cars,and walk or bike it helps save your money for something other than gas. Just think of it the average person has to fill up their gas tank at least once every one to two weeks, and if they drive constantly then once every three to five days after they had just filled up their tank. Why even waste gas to go down the street to a store or to a friends when you can use a better and more conservitive type of transportation, its nonsensicle to even drive for a short amount of time if you can walk or bike to you destination. If we also limit car usage we wont have to worry much about bumper to bumper traffic or car accidents. Think of how much much time traffic on the highways wastes sometimes 20 minutes to an hour or two when we can be doing something better with our lives. Not to mention if we limited our usage our roads sidewalks and highways would all change. There would also be more outside attractions to do and be apart of, malls and stores would be different as well considering that if not much cars are around its not necassary to have shopping plaza because not much cars would be parked. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot and change and impact the way we live in a positive way.

Think of our enviroment and ozone for a minute,and how bad the fules that power our cars effect it, not only does the fules effect our enviroment it also affects us too. When we have a high amount of smog in the air due to cars it makes people congested because our air is tainted and polluted. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid the EPA is promoting the act of reduced car communities. Its not just cars either you have motorcycles as well that harm us and the enviroment ion the same way. Not only will limiting your usage on your car will be better for your wallet it would be better for you as well considering the fact that some people if not using or having a car tend to walk or bike which is exercise and it helps to benifit you out as well as your money. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot. Considering that everyone is out of shape because of our advances in life a little walking or biking exercise will benifit us from being lazy, you can even make your walk fun with music to listen to. If we limit our usage it will help our enviroment and our health as people as well.

Cars maybe needed if you have a job or a place that you need to go that is a far stretch from where you are. Cars are very handy i'll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things. People are just lazy and depend on cars so they dont have to walk, take a bus ,or bike to their destination but its that mind set that most of us have and thats why our enviroment is getting killed slowly. We need to stop being lazy and think of better ways to get back and forth from certain areas.

Cars can are good to have for self transportation, but there are much better ways to get from place to place without hurting your wallet and your enviroment. There are plenty of benifits from limiting car usage for everyone. When we limit car usage we dont have to worry about gas prices or smog in our enviroment or anything of that nature. Limiting gas makes us better and healthier because we are finding more physical alternative ways for transportation.    ",4
07b6457,"My argument is about how the landform is just a natural occurance. I may have proof to why it may just be another hoax N.A.S.A. may be involved in. If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.

My personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community aroused and it did indeed. In the passage it said ""It even haunted grocery lines for 25 years!"" and also it played its part in movies and things like that. And only recently in 2010-2016 has there been ANY proof there has been any life or there may be any life there what so ever. The reason of that is they found a river or something I can't exactly remember. And also they (N.A.S.A.) don't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so hin and so hot they believe that it would be hard for something to grow and live on the planet mars.

Although the cars are tested multipule times, they will never be perfect. Just think about all the new Iphones or other devices that have been upgraded; they still have problems and things that people would like to be improved.

Another reason why I am against driverless cars is because people might have to learn how to drive again. Depending on how the smart cars are made, people might have to go through driving test similar to if u wanted your motorcycle license. There will be lots of new technology, responsibilites, rules, and regulations that come with the smart car. Do ur really think people would want to go through all of those test just to get another car?

The last reason why I disagree with the smart cars is beacuse of safety. The smart car can become a huge safety hazard. In paragragh nine is says,"" Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver control at all times."" This quote shows that the law believes it's safer to have a human in control. It also says,""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This quote explains my biggest consern. If someone or a feamily was severly hurt who would be to blame? Although the car was driving, the driver should be focused at all times no matter what because anything could go wrong within a matter of seconds. Would you really want to put ur family at risk?

I disagree with driverless cars. Driverless cars are very dangerous excpecially of they are not in the right hands. They can malfunction, we could have problems with people not wanting to take all the test just to get a new car, and they put lives at risk. To have a driverless car, you need to be responsible, and mature. Although its fun, it is also risky. Don't put your life or anyones elses life at risk. ",4
07c48b4,"How would I feel about being able to detect somone else's feelings? I honestly believe that it would be helpful to understand someone and what they are going through at that specific time.

My first thought on this opinion is that it must of took a while to actually build this and to think of the idea as to what you could use to figure it all out. When Dr. Paul Eckman built this he must of had to be thinking about other people and the concept of wanting to help others. In pargraph four it proclaims ""By weighing hte differnt units, the software can identitfy mixed emotions"". Dr. Eckman was on the right track building this because any human being can feel up to 3 emotions at once and he knew just that so he figured he would build it be able to detect not just one but mulitple.

In pargraph 5 it says ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial triat that conveys it"". By the arthour of this article I feel like he knows the cainf anf genorosity of being there and helping a friend. This being made is awesome because I don't know about you but most of the times i'm down or angery I don't like to tell people why or event talk about it being I will get even more upset no matter the size of the issue. The FACS is just the answer for helping a friend in need when you know they need the comfort but don't want to say anything.

There is so many good things about this new software that only genius could of thought of. A drama coach once made his kids practice making happy and sad faces due to actually feeling the emotions before they went on to a play. Placed before me in paragraph 9 ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" Did you know that actually listeing to you friends or parents when they say ""put on a happy face"" it may help. Study shows that this actually can make you happy and being happy is more of what we need in this world.

I highly agree with this article and give it a 10/10 considering it is a very kind think to do and not to mention a brillant idea. All the emotions it can detect right down to the percent in unbelieveable. It can take us far ways and may even make the world a better place. Being happy is the number onekey to a great life and everyone deserves that.   ",4

07c7556,"I belive that the development of driverless cars should be continued because they help those who are unaware of whats happening by giving them warnings and automatically stoping on their own.

Driverless cars would be agreat thing for us and even though you have to manually on your own, back in and out of the parking lot or deal with traffic issues, thats still just a small simple task. Lately Google has a modified a car named the Toyota Prius. This car has position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video mounted camera near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. The most important thing about this car, is that it has a Dubbed LIDAR, which uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. These appliances to a car are very helpful for the driver. It allows them to see whats behind them, sensors that lets the car no when something is coming, and it checks the cars surroundings.

Technology has been producing more and more ways for us to have driverless cars. So far, cars aren't completly driverless yet, but they can steer, accelerate, and brake all by themselves. They are all designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. So, humans still have to be alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires them. GM has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Maufactors are considering adding cameras to watch that drivers are focused on the road. While the driver

watches the road, the car watches the driver,

There are still laws that human driver must be in control at all times. if there are to be an continuation of driverless cars, they will have to make new laws so that they can cover liability.

So driverless cars are still continuing on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Many car companies are planning new things for ther future, like Tesla has a projected in 2016 they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time, and Mercedes- Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that drive themselves by 2020. So, the road to truly driverless cars continues on, and we grow closer and closer to our goal every day for the new age of cars.",4
07ca280,"Dear  State Senator, 1/23/15

I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a

""winner- take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate."" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is becuase it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or  causes many disruptions in our country.

Sincerly, a very patriotic citizen,

07cd836,"One uses a car to go to the store, pick someone up, or even to go shopping, but what if people had no cars? Not having a car would have advantages.

To start with, not having a car helps the enviroment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in th eUnited Stated."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 5). Without cars the air will become cleaner and people won't have all the polution in the air. Our air will get better if we start not having cars.

Also, another advantage is that people will get healthier. No polution gives people healthier air and with no cars people will have to walk everywhere or bike. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular swuare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are bing adopted around the world in attempts to make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to the public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 6). Ones destination will be a walk away not miles. People will just walk, bike, and if their destination is far away one will take public transportaion. One will become more active without cars.

Finally, driving is comming to an end. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the Untied States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (The end of car culture, paragraph 29). Gas cost more, people are getting hurt while texting and driving, and some people just don't know how to drive. People seem to be getting over cars. This could help the enviroment. Driving just isn't a priority.

In conclusion, having no more cars would benifit people. The enviroment will be better and people are getting over cars anyways. Why drive a car that harms the air, when one could simpily walk or ride a bike making one healthier too? Not having cars would help.    ",4
07cde52,"My argument for the development of these cars is against it because i do not agree with some stuff such as the cars driving its self.

If a car drives it's self then it would be no fun for people who have cars. This development is crazy because it will change many things. We should keep cars the way they are instead of changing them to something different that not everyone would like.

Many cars are already having many problems so why make a car that can drive its self? We should fix the problems in todays cars instead of worrying about trying to bring something new. People are putting to much in cars, such as sensors and computer hardware. These things might help but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, but not everything can be sure to always work. Anything can fail at anytime.

Technology is really advanced! Everyday people are working on something new because of how well technology is. If technology keeps on advanving people will make more things and come out with incredible things. Many of these things won't be safe. People have to think in the safety of theres and others. It is not a great idea If you let a car do everything for you because that could be dangerous. You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good.

Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars. We should stay with what we have until we are 100% sure about things. ",4
07ce28e,"In the age of technology, we are constantly searching for better ways to communiucate to computers. It seems as though they are just blocks of plastic, wiring, and metal that have no empathy, brains, or hearts. But what if computers could understand human emotion? The computer could know what we are feeling and give us results to match that mood. This is becoming a reality for society today, as a new software, the Facial Action Coding System has promising results for understanding and catergorizing human emotions. This technology could be used in the classroom, where it would provide a better learning environment for students if the computer could understand the students and know if they were bored or tired, and would adjust its program accordingly.

The Facial Action Coding System was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illnois and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. The FACS first costructs a 3-D model of the face with all 44 face muscles. Movement of one or muscles is called an action unit. Dr. Paul Eckman, another creator of FACS, has ""classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated them with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles."" The FACS was tested on the Mona Lisa, and detected her as ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" A computer being able to understand human emotion would be groundbreaking, as ""most human communication is nonverbal, including, emotional communication."" We as humans have a variety of expressions, from huge ones to very subtle changes in mood. Computers need to understand these, along with the subtle facial movements that go with them. A extensive calculation is needed in order to acheive this goal. We humans perform this 'calculation' every day, as we can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face by taking their facial cues into consideration of their emotion. A comptuter that could a similar thing as such would know when you're happy or sad, and then react accordingly. If you were to smile at a Web ad, it would send a similar one. But if you frowned, the next one would be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Hunag predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for a better learning environment and teaching skills for students.

The use of this technology would be outstanding and unbelievably helpful in the classroom. It could accurately identify a student's emotions and change the lesson plan to meet their own academic needs. This technology not only can identify emotions, but can help humans to react to them. With more expressive characters in video games and movies, humans can identify and repilcate such emotions, as we have empathy. Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions, and computers with the FACS software could allow for that and much more to occur. Technology as we know it today could be changed forever. If computers do acquire the FACS software, then it would be able to identify human emotions and adjust accordingly.",3
07d1a3b,"Living in a world of unusual habits and features would be overbearing and apprehensive for individuals. All people have a structure for their own living while following their beliefs or customs. Human beings have evolved from a variety of settings which has enabled them to create enternal memories or daily habits of their own kind. Individuals studying another environment such as Venus will bring different and numerous facets to their life. People practicing the components of the planet Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the planet's features, the knowledgement that scientists will discover, and the producement of devices.

To begin, Earth is a contrasting planet that isn't identical to any other aspect in space. However, the planet earth and Venus have obtained similar qualites that would result into a much bigger asssumption. Centries ago Venus had acquired oceans that covered the planet just as Earth. According to the passage, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Life forms being a possibilty on Venus protrays that any kind of living such as humans or animals can be capable of surviving on this planet. Even though life has the ability to live on Venus, the only obstacle involved with this theory are the animals and human beings adapting to a new way of living. Moreover, people and animals getting use to their new structure of life on Venus will be able to use the qualities that the planet performs as of today. The passage states, ""Today, Veuns still has a some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar featres such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus having the same facets as Earth represents that life on this planet will destruct and kind of livng. At last, the studying and the consideration of life on Venus will be an enormous movement for the nation.

In conclusion, people practicing the components of Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the planet's features, the knowlegement, and the creation of devices.    ",2

I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president. If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal. If you have a solid regional favorite you go for them states first then you work around to different states to get more Electoral votes but then if you leave that state that was with you all the way then they atomatically switch to the other person that has been campaigning around all the other states and takes your states what are you supposed to do then? The only thing you can do is just go back and try to get your state back..

07d41ed,"The use of the Facial Action Conding System would be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it will detect how the student feels about the task at hand. If it detects that the student is bored it could modify the lesson to make them more awake and begin working on the task at hand. This technology could also help find each students way of learning. For example if one student works hands on and another works by taking notes then the system can mofify both programs to fit their learning style. This technology also could help teachers see if a student understands a topic, and if they see they don't or they are becoming frustrated with it they can modify the lesson. Using this system would be of value to students and schools, because it not only would help students learn but it would also help teacher teach.

If a student is feeling bored with his or her work the Facial Ation Coding System can modify the task at hand and make the student more prone to continue and finish the work. This claim is supported by the article because it says ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This would help the teacher help the student make changes. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This technology not only helps students become more inclined in school work but it also helps teachers

This technology could help find each students way of learning by detecting each facial expression to see if they are inclined in the task at hand. For example, if one student is understanding and enjoying the way a lesson is being taught, the system could modify each of their lessons to fit their way of learning. But if another student doesn't like the way a lesson is being taught the system can test out different styles until the correct one is found. The article supports this by stating ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow."" This example could go for both advertisment and school work. ""If you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system can be used to see if a student is enjoying and understanding a lesson as well as not enjoying and understanding a lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System could help teachers see if a student is understanding a topic or lesson. It could do this by detecting their facial expression then letting the teacher know if changes need to be made. This would help because it allows the teacher to know if thier methods of teaching are acually being of value to the student. This claim is supported because the article includes ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This supports the claim because it shows that the software can identify not only one emotion but serveral. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The technology can analize and detect certain emotions and allow the teacher to see all of them and make modifcations if they are needed.

Using this system would be a value to schools because it not only helps students learn but it would help teachers teach. It would allow teachers to see how certain kids learn and modify their lessons to fit. It would also allow students to be more inclined in the task at hand. This system would be a great value to education and how kis are taught.         ",6
07d6f42,"Technology has been vastly improving these past couple of years. With all these new technological improvements it can also play a major factor in classrooms. All teenagers these days are very ""tech-friendly"". Therefore it would only make sense that we should incorporate some of these technological adavances

into the classroom so students could be more engaged during class. It would greatly improve many homework scores, quiz scores, and even test scores

thus overall having many improvements to their grades in all.

The new software "" Facial Action Coding System"" has been a huge technological improvement to this time.

In the passage it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements---in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotion."" This can show how in a classroom if students are being active during a lesson and participating. Or if they are dozing off somewhere else with the help of this technology then the computer can change its algorithms to change how the lesson is being taught therefore making the student pay attention during class.

In a classroom filled with some kids that just can't focus and/or do not understand then this technology can come into great use. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" the passage states. This technology could help students that have trouble with some classes or just are not paying attention whatsoever, in the passages it also states,

""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With this technology it can highly improve on keeping the students attention at all times, this can help the students with making sure they know whats going on during class at all times instead of zoning out then missing something very cruical and overall messing alot of things up but instead keeping them highly engaged at all times.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is greatly valuable. The use of this technological advancement would greatly improve students comprehension of some classes in school that they might've not understood before. It would be more personalized to that specific person, the more confused you look the more different ways it would look to make sure you understand the concept. Thus making the student very proactive and improving their overall grade. ",3

07e11fc,"The Face on Mars

There is a great population of people who believe aliens exist and cause strange things to happen and space crafts to appear. Many people know that it is just science fiction and that there is no evidence showing that aliens actually exist. This has been going on for decades and the believers need to face the truth. They can belive as long as they want, but there is no evidence.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform. Meteors and other space rocks strike the planets, and even the moon. Those can be a possible cause of the Face on Mars. With astronauts exploring Mars to see if it is capable of supporting life, the Face could be caused by the humans collecting large amounts of the planet and walking all over it. Aliens are nothing but a fictional character in the many Hollywood movies.

As humans with the sense of sight, we are used to seeing faces on a daily basis. We look at clouds and depict them as something we have seen before. Or a tree that looks like a face was made out of it's bark. It is understandable that you could see a face on Mars because that is human imagination. The Face is just a natural effect of what caused it to happen. Sure, we might not know about everything that goes on in space, but we do know that many people are interested in the fact that Mars may be able to suport life.

Scientist are doing everything they can to know more than enough about Mars. They have rovers and cameras to look at Mars from Earth and be able to study it without traveling all the way there. There are many photos and videos of Mars and what you might see there, but no aliens were found. Their equipment is high quality and no blurs or scratches could be seen as something it's not.

For those who support the belief that aliens roam Mars, they can invest on the discovery, but find it wasteful. The Face is just a landform and you would need evidence to support your alien claim. There are many photos that were taken over time of the Face and the differences could be because of erosion or asteroids. Many things go on in space, but alien activity isn't one of them.  ",3
07e4b76,"Do you think that the ""Face on Mars"" is not a real face but just a natural landform? Well, we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, it rereal that it's just a natural landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West.

First of all, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surefers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing that it's just a natural landform.

Next, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. ""So, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!""

On the other hand, some people might say that the Mars Orbiter Camera team didn't take the photo cleary than the original Viking photos or they could think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars but, on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" said Garvin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Last, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landforms common aroung the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, we think that the ""Face on Mars"" is not a real face but just a natural landform because we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural

landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West. There were no Alien monument after all.

07e7133,"Dear Senator,

I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.

First off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don't spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winner-takes-all system as said by the Office of the Federal Regiser in ""What is the Electoral College?"". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state's population, but imagine this; California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this to-be-president and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn't get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren't for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ingnoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.

To continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we're voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who's gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you're really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.

Yours truly,

07e96aa,"The Face on Mars was a mysterious topic for several years. The Face was believed to be an alien monument. However, through research, NASA was able to confirm that the Face is in fact not an alien monument, but instead a natural landform on the surface of mars.

This famous picture has gotten a lot of attention in the media. What some people may not realize is that the photograph was taken through clouds. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" Some believed alien markings were hidden by the haze, but perhaps the haze was instead covering up detail in the landform that would show that it is not a face, nor an alien monument, but instead just a natural landform. NASA also happened to have technology that could clear up this picture. The technology used to explain this photograph was described by stating, ""You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This shows that NASA has the technology needed to explain this image. After using this technology, the image was revealed. The text claims that the photograph shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. It is also said in the passage that these are common lanforms in the American West. It is clear that this landform is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, and it certainly is no alien monument.

In conclusion, after research, it was releaved that this unknown formation located in Cydonia on Mars had no connection to aliens and instead was a natural land formation, similar to some landforms on Earth.",3

Venus is the second planet from our sun .While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous sacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere

However ,perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far abover the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mot forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere ,rendering standard forms of photgraphy and videography ineffective .

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus .For examle ,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been teted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weks in such conditions .The thought of devices make a calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our planet .The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys ,mountainsand crater ,Furthermore,recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit ,a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel

In conclusion of the authors suggestion on studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite all the dangers it presents .I think that people should really study Venus and its features that it comes with it does with dangers but you would get a lot out of it just reading this makes you want to go visit Venus.

07f4106,"Facial Action Coding System allows computers around humans to read their emotion based by the look on their face. Dr. Huang tells that this device can tell your emotion because of the muscles in your face and how they are either tightened or relaxed. FACS should be used on students so teachers can help them talk it out, help them understand the material that is being teached and help them learn the emotion of people around them.

Using FACS on students should be allowed. If using FACS in a classroom full of teenagers, a teacher will just see a room filled with hormonal teens. They will just ignore it and think they are just moody. Or a teacher could see how upset a student is and ask if they are okay. This computer could become useful in helping students when they are upset or angry. If could allow the teacher to talk to them and check up on them every once in a while. FACS can detect the six basic emotions such as surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer will detect these emotions through the movement of the muscles.

Teachers can use FACS to help students understand the subject more clearly. Learning and understanding school is very important to young students, they need the knowledge to go and be successful in the future. Teachers want to know if a student is getting confused while listening to a lecture. It is important for teachers to know how to help their students. This computer will help out with the use of studying and scaning how their facial muscles are being moved or how their eyebrows are being lifted.

Knowing how someone around another could help out a lot. If this FACS could really detect human emotions just from the expression on the face and movement of the muscles then it could help a human understand how the person next to them is feeling. Zygomatic major are the muscles that begin in your cheek bones, they life the corners of your mouth. That muscle can determined if someone is giving a forced smile or genuine smile. This could help a person know when another is upset and needs space or if another is in need of comforting. It could also help to see if someone is angry and needs time to cool down.

FACS is able to help people talk out the emotion they are feeling, help them understand material that is being taught to them and help them learn the emotion of people around them. FACS will be able to conclude a feeling of a person and will possibly be able to help someone. Knowing how someone is feeling is very important because then people will know how to appoarch them and how to talk to them. FACS would be very successful in helping others out and it could be used to know a person feels. ",4
07f838d,"I think this technology might be helpful for students, but it could also be a bad thing. It could be good for students becase it would show how they really feel about the work so the teacher would know that their confused, bored, or angry. In the paragraph 3 it talks about what it is capible of in facial recognizion and how it could chage a lesson to better suit a student just by their facial expression. I also believe it could be a bad thing. For example would you like someone to know what you're thinking just by your exepression. Lets say your're talking to a friend of yours and they ask you what you think about their favorite song and you know its their favorite song, but you really don't like it all and you dont want to maybe hurt their feelings by saying what you really think, so you might say "" it's ok"" or ""not my style"". Now think if this technology was out there that you might not be able to do that, and you might not be able to hide how you really feel. That is why I think this technology could be a good thing and a bad thing.",2
07f8601,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens it was a natural land form. There a many reasons that make it seem like the land form could have been made by aliens, but on the other hand there was no signs of any living thing that could have done this. there are many thing with this object that could lead you to beliveing either it was made by aliens.

In 1976 the Vikking took the picture that was bellived to look like a face. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over mars snapping pictuers that were ten times sharper than the first picture of then the first picture taken. By increaseing the sharpness of the picture it showed that it was a land form. The time of year that the first picture was taken it was a cloudy over the Red Planet. This could have made shadow that made the form look like it had eyes and nosie.

The last time the picture was taken (2001) the picture was taken in maximum resolution. This maximum photo if taken of earth you could see the pirimds in Egypt. So if there was anything weird the picture would have shown it.

In conclusion the picture taken in 2001 '' actually shows is the Martin eqivalent of a butte or mesa----landforms common around the American West.''(paragraph 12). All signs are now pointing to the fact that it was a natural landform. In the end NASA found out what it really was and that alines making this figure was false.",3

in my opinon i do not think their should be a machine that could read my emotions ever i belive privacy is important and the will for someone to express their emotions to someone whom they may care about is sometimes sacred or personal varying on the person. technology that tracks the way our muscles move could be used for other puposes the machine can even track if were angry and how our lips tighten around our mouth ,this other ways we could use such as facial recongtion, best said himself "" even though indiviuals showing varying degrees of expression"" these could identify someones facial muscles even if they had face suregy or we could use this as machinery as facial reconstructions benifts .if its able to identify muscles of every unique person even famous art work like the mona lisa then this could have other benifts we could even look into the past to tell how historical figures were feeling in paintings or older photos. or we also could use to know animals emotions and how we can make an animal have a better day or stop animal related accidents from happening such as animal attacks. One good reason is if women could know if how we really felt about that dress the one they asked our opinons about then the trouble comes. often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves .

0811694,"Who doesn't like the idea of sitting back, sipping on your coffee while reading the paper as your car whisk you to your destination? Sadly, as wonderful as it may sound, that is not the case with ""Driverless Cars."" Driverless cars are not really a grand idea as they may seem because even though they say that they are driverless and are suppose to be safe, you must always be alert when driving them, there is a chance that the car maybe unsafe, and without a doubt, they are more than likely going to be expensive.

These suppose driveless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but it carries sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. And although the car is designed to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves, it is designed to notify the driver when it requires human skills on a road ahead. Which then require the driver of this ""driverless car"" to be alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. This makes the term driverless car pointless.

Having to always be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world and it isn't the only thing that people have to worry about. In many states they have banned the use of computer driven cars because they believe that humans are the only safe drivers. Although in many cases this may not be true, a human driver seems more truthworthy than a computer that may or may not short circut at any moment. Humans seem to be more reliable but if people ever see to change their minds and laws change, it will still come down to one question as stated in the text, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?

Other than these cars being unsafe, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably cost them an arm and a leg. Seeing as how these smarter cars are suppose to be smarter and more high tech. Which leads to the next question, what makes a ""smarter car"" smarter? Well according to the passage Google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear whieel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, an intertial motion sensor, and a dubbed LIDAR, not including the things inside the car. This all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash and as time progresses and technology improves, so will the sensors and as things get better, the preformence will go up but so will the value, making the car more expensive to make.

Ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, don't seem so smart or so driverless because they still require a driver to be alert, they don't seem so safe, and they will probably cost a ton of money. So they require a drivers assistance everytime it can't do anything on its own, making the name driverless car pointless. Another human being would seem more trutworthy behind the wheel than a computer. Then lastly they probbaly cost more than a colege students yearly tuition. Need there be more said about why driverless cars are just a bad idea? ",4
08133fe,"The technology to read a emotional expression is not valuable .Because computer are wrong everyday they are the smarts thing on earth but they still get stuff wrong once in a while . They don't know the true feeling of happy and sad . They just computers .

There millions of reason why it not valuable well for one a person could be looking happy in the picture but be reallly sad emotional . I see it everyday at in the world .Like for explain when someone die and they go to a furel you got to look cool or happy ,but on the inside your heart broken and never be the same . And you take a picture on a computer and it would say you are happen but you really not because computer don't know emontional they just know knowledge .

I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional . But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things .We dont need computer to see people emotional we can tell by the way a person talk . If that person sound like he or she got a additon (come back) that mean that person is in a bad mood and don't want to talk at that time . A computer wouldn't even know he or she in a good mood or not by the way they talk. Another good reason why it's not valuable.

Does computer even have emotional?

I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal . Compuer don't know what true happence or sadness mean they just tell us whatever they programer put inside them. True happness is something you don't feel its just there . Sadness is somthing thats doesn't feel good something that hurts on the inside.

081b620,"Emotions are sometimes difficult to read. If there is technology that can make reading emotions easier, why be agaisnt it? Using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

The use of this technology can change the preception of schooling. In the artice, Dr. Huang predicts that the classroom computer will be able to modify the lesson when it recognizes a student is becoming confused or bored. This will help students who struggle to understand some class material. The computer can, based on the students emotion, change the way the material is seen, heard, and understood. If a computer can read the emotions of someone who is trying to study, it can alter the way the person studies to make it easier and more enjoyable. This can help graduation rates rise and dropout rates lower.

Some may argue that using this technology isn't fair to the students. That students emotions shouldn't be read by a computer. That to understandable. However, some students are afraid to ask for help because they don't want to be precieved as dumb or unintelligent. With this system, the students emotions will be confidentually read and then used to help the student.

081db56,"I think that the new technology, FACS

which stands for facial action coding system is valuable. Because knowing how others are feeling can help develop stronger relationships and bonds with friends and family. And can also help a person console another person if they are feeling sad, lonely, and angry, even if the other person doesn't show their true emotions/ feelings.

And the technology FACS

can recognize different human emotions such as sadness or happiness even if the person's face doesn't have any emotion or expressions on it.

And we could also learn more on how our emotions change from time to time and why they change.

And could help develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

And it would help people that have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, and other emotions like that.

And it may help with teaching students. Like, say if a person is bored they probably won't learn as much as someone who isn't bored. Or that if someone is confused they don't really learn anything and it doesn't really help them focus either. But someone who isn't confused or isn't bored will likely learn better than those who are confused or bored.

If it is something that the student likes or is intersted it they will likely listen and probably won't be confused nor bored. But if it is something that they don't really like or it isn't interesting to them then they may not pay attention to it and may get bored and/or get confused.

And may help people learn and grow well.

And also if the person learning doesn't really like the lesson or is not interested or is bored or confused then the computer can change the lesson to something that the student will probably like and not be bored or confused with anything on or in the lesson. Or the computer can suggest something else or another lesson for the student to do to see if they do better in the lesson and enjoy it more and focus more.

It can improve education and how well students know everything and can encourage good attitudes and positive things in the present and the future.

Also, it can help encourage people to talk more often and make friends and to also encourage people to help others and things like that.

And maybe advise teachers in a way to make the lesson their teaching more enjoyable and helpful by playing games or letting students have a group of partners to help them and such.

And may help students have better grades/ do better in school and maybe even do better in extra- curricular activities such as sports.

And help student focus on the things they need to do. And help the teachers to make lessons where it will help the students learn better and be more fun for them.

May also inspire people to work harder or more and do different things and come up with new or different ideas and such. And may even motivate the person to do something that they want to do or accomplish.

Possibly even to pursue goals and/ or dreams . And technology can help us with a lot of different things like understanding how things work and other things like that. ",3

0821b94,"The world of automotive technology is constanly changing for what engineers believe is the best for society. There are always new and improved ideas for cars, but some of them may not be in the best interest for people. The idea of a car that drives itself seems both unreliable and unrealistic. After reading this passage the idea of a self-driving car seems like more of a hassle than the number one item on a person's Christmas list.

The ""driverless"" cars of today are far from not needing drivers. Most cars, like the Toyota Prius, have many sensors within the car. Though these sensors do help alert the driver if the car is out of control, they do not fix the siuation or get themselves out of it. I have been in a Toyota Prius on a dangerous, icey road, and the car did alert the driver when we were out of control, but the car did not correct the situation it rather made a loud beeping noise and had a flashing signal on the dash. These cars are not driving themselves, but instead relying on the drivers to pay attention to their warnings.

Self-driving cars are also a problem when it comes to legal situations. Dr. Werner Huber believes that entertainment while driving is a great idea for drivers who still need to pay attention to the road. So what happens when a driver is distracted and does not adhere to their self-driving car's warnings? Well the same probelm that occurs with drivers every day. There will still be wrecks and deaths. These cars are not making the roads a safer place, but instead making legal situations more confusing by not knowing who is at fault for an accident.

Though these cars have no large, positive effect on society engineers still continue to work every day on them. These cars are not changing what the base of a car is, but are getting plenty of attention for it. Self-driven cars are unachievable, and they do not benefit society in a positive way.",3

082e9df,"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking concepts to the suburbs. Residents of an upscale community in Germany have given up their cars, generating a revolutionary change.

Limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, a resident of Bogota, Columbia. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, but thanks to the partial driving ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. By reducing the amount of driving we do, we could decrease the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into our atmosphere, ultimately creating a greener, healthier enviornment for all of earths inhabitants.

An improvement in society is also being made due to the ambitious goals to decrase car usage. Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout cities; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The worlds love affair with vehicles seem to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly nine percent below the peak and equal to where the countr was in January of 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures, the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. If the pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.

""All of our development since World War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. By decreasing the amount of car usage, we could generate enough change to truly change the world.    ",4

0848273,"The ""face on Mars"" is not a face at all. The shadows cause this landformation to appear to have a mouth, nose, and eyes. In the 2001 photo it was summer, so there was no shadows to cast the facial features as in the 1976 photo. If Nasa really discovered life on Mars they would tell the public because it would be a huge discovery. These conspiracy theorists say aliens are so smart, well if they are so smart why haven't they contacted us.

Why would these oh so genious aliens waste time on making this face? I'll tell you why, because they dont exist it was just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The people of Nasa have done as much as they can with this natural landformation. They took another photo in 1998 after the first photo because they wanted to prove it wasn't aliens.

The photo in 2001 proved that it was not an alien creation. These theorists say all these things that make Nasa seem so protective and amke it seem like they hide information. If Nasa were hiding information why would they release the photo in the first place. If it were alien markings and they knew about it why take two more photos, to prove the theorists were wrong. One day they will land on Mars, and Nasa will prove to us that there are no ancient life forms there. When they land and prove us wrong the conspiracy theorists will stay say they are lying.

The theorists love to make people believe what they want because it's all about the best conspiracy. If one were to have the better conspiracy they would knock their compition out of the way. They make money on how many subscribers they get and the better the conspiracy, the more subscribers.

Some poeple will always doubt what Nasa really searches for. They don't understand that Nasa is not in it for personal gain. They are searching for answers for answers about our universe and if there was alien life forms Nasa would tell the people with so much joy and wonder. One day we will know the truth.",4
084cdc4,"I think the computer the students are using to identify human emotions is valuable. It could useful for many things in the world or can use for important uses like if people are lying. This techology could be helpful to scientists for many uses or like in the article says for identify paints or surgeries. In the following paragraghs i will give my reason why its a good reason to the FACS and evidenece.

The reason i agree that they should have the FACS is because it could be used for alot of things like see who is confused or lost, and if someone is lying when they are introuble, and even if they need it for a painting like this artcle. I think people always questioned if mona lisa is happy or mad, or even confused. In the artricle on paragraph 3 it says that the computer can classifi if someone or some painting is happy, sad, anger, fear, and disgusted. So what they did is they made the painting 3-d and scanned her face to see what was her emotions were during da vinci was painting and also it says that the computer can also major 44 muscles on our face and can tell if we are happy or sad. on paragraph 1 the result of what emotion mona lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful andf 2% angry. this result could be right or just what the computer thinks what her emotion was in that very moment da vinci was painting her.

In conclusion i do think FACS is valuable because it could help figuring out emotions on people in paintings like da vinci, help during surgery, help the teacher know if people did understand the lesson or not, and help people know who is lying or not.",2
084e848,"I think that the idea of driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are necessary at all. They are pointless and cars should be driven manually. The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen.

A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, ""psychological aspects are really a challenge,"" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the investment. They will still need human assistance and drivers will be bored waiting for their turn to drive. The amount of gas needed will still be the same to power all the cars. This is why driverless cars are pointless.                         ",2
085092e,"The Face has many reasons that in may be from aliens, but there are also many reasons against it. How you choose your final answer will have to do with your world view. Your mind may change once you hear different information.

May 24, 2001 was when the Face was first spotted. There were no other other landforms or artifatcts spotted on this mission. This is the first problem. If there were aliens that previously inhabited the plant, why would there be no other evidence? The only factor making it appear to be an Egyptian Pharaoh was the shadows casted on the rest of the structure. Though Michael Malin was able to get closer,clearer pictures of the landform, it still did not give straight evidence that aliens exsisted. If the Face did prove that aliens did once walk Mars, why would they be Egyptian? Scientist can only compare the structure to what they know, which is not much. Since the Face is equal to a mesa or butte, how would that be possible? Mesas and buttes are not caused by man, but by erosion and natural processes. The Face was most likely formed by coincidence.

Though there is no exact explanation for the Face on Mars, it is still interesting. If you belived in aliens, you would believe in is an artifact left by ""Martians"". If you do not believe in aliens, you would simply believe it happened because of natural processes as if it were a mesa or butte. Without proper evidence, we are left to believe in whatever we would like.      ",2
08519b2,"Since Henry Ford made the first Model T, people have been obsessed with the idea of transportation.  This idea has evolved into many things between then and now.  We now have entire sports dedicated to cars and motorcycles, cars powered by alternate energy sources, and many other novel concepts that have taken the world by storm.  However, there are many potential advantages of limiting your use of our precious automobiles.

One of the first reasons that you should reduce your usage of cars is found all around us, in the environment.  Some statistics of the current amount of damage we cause by using our cars like we do include that fact that passenger cars are responsibel for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some areas of the United States.  Imagine if we could reduce those numbers?  David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America (a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United states), said ""How much you drive is as important as whether you drive a hybrid.""  There are some places that are taking this concept to heart.  One example of this is in Bogota, Columbia, where on certain days every year, a Day Without Cars in the captial city leaves only buses and taxis with permission to be on the roads.  Despite the rain on the third time the event took place, the turnout was still great.  There were even other cities, Cali and Valledupar, that took part in the fun.  Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic about what they saw.  The country of Colombia has made a concious effort to reduce their carbon footprint since the mid-1990s.  Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicicyle paths as well as parks and sports centers have also cropped up.  This also in turn resulted in an improved economy as new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up. The current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has also recently unveiled ambitious goals to curb the US's greenhouse gas emmisions.  Wouldn't it be great if we could all help the environment out by reducing our usage of cars?

How great would it be, if at the same time as leanding the earth a helping hand, you were able to improve your own happiness?  In Vauban, Germany and several other places globally, this has already begun to take effect.  The people of this city are part of the ""Smart Planning"" movement.  This experimental community on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders, is taking reducing autombile usage to a whole new level.  Seventy percent of Vauban's families simply do not own a car.  Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two living in Vauban, said ""When I had a car, I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way,"" as she walked the verdant streetes where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering people drown out an occasional distant motor.  The ""Smart Planning"" movement isn't just restricted to this place though.  It is merely an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use.  In Bogota, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" on a Day Without Cars.  Some may still say though, ""How if by giving up my car, will I be happier?  I will have to find some other transportation mean and potentially have to wake up much earlier than I already to get everywhere.  That seems more stressful to me.""  However, due to the recession in the US, many people are having to do adapt this type of lifestyle out of necessity.  Many can't afford new vechiles but still must get to work somehow.  Even after the recession ends, many sociologists believe that many will not return their previous way of life.

Finally, there are already many plans in place to reduce automobile usage.  At the

Mobile World Congress in 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan that shows how impractical or undesireable it will be for many to own a vehicle.  He also proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create ciries in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.""  The Environment Protection Agency as well as legislators are promoting the reduced use of personal vehicles by working to induct a new six-year federal transportation bill, rather than previous ones that have devoted about eighty percent of the appropriations have gone to highway improvements and the remaining twenty percent to other transport.

To wrap everything up, there are many reasons that everyone should try to reduce automobile use.  For one, it will help the environment, it will increase general happiness, and finally, that there are plans that are already in place to make it more feasable for people to adopt this new lifestyle.  Whether we will see a drastic change or not, we will not know until we try.  But that all starts, with you.            ",5

085f158,"Dear State Senator,

Lately there has been lots of tense debates on whether to keep Electoral College votes or not. Well I agree with the citizens who do agree on keeping our votes. Its just rude to take away something we rightfully deserve. Electors come to the campus or a specific area to give their great speech that appeals to what we want to be done just to get our votes. Well Mr. Senator it isn't ok for you and the others in office to just take away Electral College voting.

According to this article written by : The Office of the Fedral register,

"" the Founding fathers esatblished it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popuar vote of qualifed citizens.""

that little bit of information says a popular vote I believe the Electoral College is that popular vote. After the electors are selected and meet to discuss who would be Preident and Vice President but also need to count the Electoral votes. Not only does the congress count the electoral votes , there is 538 electors but at least 270 votes are required to elect the preisdent.

In another article it explains how the year of

""2000 was a fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.""

There is a example

Al Gore he won the popular vote but not the presidency .And that majority would have preferred a direct election. Also the electoral voters system voted slate, an example given from the story was if I lived in Texas I would vote for Jonh Kerry, then vote for slate of 34 democratic electorsthat pledged to Kerrry.

Even with great arguments of wiping out Electoral votes , it will still remain

""unfair outdated and irrational

"" I see a picture which shows the number of electroal votes that each state is granted. Some states are granted more than other states but that doesn't stop them from voting. There are fueds over the outcome,picking the president, then goes into the swing states, Big states, and run-off elections .

Now the certainty of outcome of a Electoral vote its not likey to beat a popular vote.

But electoral votes win because those votes are more than popular votes. Back in 2012 voting the article says"" Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the poplular votes.""

and that help Obama win on the winner-take-all basis. Now with picking the president they can't recieved gain of votes where ever there from or very well favored. A president with regional appeal isn't likey to be a successful president.

Now those swing states, with the winner-take-all method and being awarded with electoral votes. But voters in the toss-up states are the ones who really pay attention and listen to competators in the campagion. And decide the election. But in the big states electoral college restores the political balance which large states lost by virtue. The bug states get more of the canidate attention than small states because big states has more population.

Refering back to the article it says electoral avoids the problems with elections , with that no canidate recieves no votes from that majority.

Imagine back in 1968 with Nixon and Clinton in 1992 both only gotten 43 pecent of the popular votes . The pressure of a run-off election is when no canidate wins , it will greatly make things complicated in the presidental elction.

So no Senator you and your fellow peers whom decided to eliminate electoral votes is dispicable. When we actually have a chance to vote you take it away. Its very clear that without the electoral votes it woud be more than just presidental complication it would also be complication with decideing electors, presidntal electors and the big states who canidates get there precious votes from would have a hard time winning.

I agree to keeping the Electoral College vote and not to change it to no popular vote because popular vote over rules most of the time. So please over think your decsion with other senators and keep Electoral College votes.    ",2
08629e7,"The use of this technology to ready the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Why? to me this idea has some pros and cons. In the case of the Mona Lisa it seems a lot more reasonalbe to use this type of technology because in reality if we just look at the painting we dont know what her emotions are but since whis new Facial Action Coding System came out it'd be a lot more usefull on her than in students in a classroom.

Now these days students don't have a lot of excitment to come to school and are often distracted with the other things going on around them. If you have the Facial Action Coding System have them identify their emotions they will pay even less more attention in class. Wether or not a student isn't as excited to do math homework is the FACS gonna be able to change the students way of feeling towards the homework? Will the students way of feeling about homework change by a computer system? I honestly dont think it'd be a good idea to have that kind of system in a classroom.

In my opinion the idea of having it in a classroom is a bad idea. This system may work on other things but not in a classroom with students. This system can also fail. If a student is happy but just has a serious face the sysytem is going to go by what the student looks like not the way he/she actually feels inside.

Technology now a days is taking over everything, this FACS

will just make people much lazier because they know that instead of asking the way they feel they'll just want to use the system because its much faster and easier instead of going up to the person and actually asking how they feel. It'll create less comunication with one another.

The Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to me a useful technology system for students in a classroom.",3

The author that wrote this passage had very good support to support his passage over Venus. The author told us about how Venus is very dangerous but is a very intersting planet to study . Also, he told us about how about the features and the history about Venus. The author suports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that Venus have. The author supports the idea very well because he added facts. Also he did very well with suporting his claim because he have good look passages. also he states that, ""Also notatable,Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closest to the sun"". So this means that Venus is dangerous even if you go to it is too hot to even step foot on.

Although they have a meeting where they are voting for President and Vice President, doesn't the citizens of United States do the same thing. Since we help choose our states electors when we vote for which President we want, why can't our vote be the last vote to count?

Qualified citizens of the United States should have the final say so on who we want our President to be. We choose our President based off of what they said they will do to make the USA a better place. Instead of the citizens voting for a state elector we should vote for who we want President. Since we will be living in the type of envoriment they set.

The Electoral College is unfair to votes because of the winner take all system they have in each state. And if the Electoral College can't decide or have a tie , the election would be thrown to the House of Represetatives where  they vote on the President. What about what the citizen of the United States want our President to be?

Since the state legislatures are tehnically repsonible for picking the electors , those electors could always defy the will of the people. So leaving the vote up the elecotor is another reason why we should not keep the Electoral College. Citizens that vote can not control who the electors vote for. The electors can even get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. Or even take the advantage of thier own to vote for who they think is right, rather who the citizens wanted them to vote for.               ",3

That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

If the Face on Mars was created by unknown life forms, NASA would have no reason to hide it. Many conspiracy theorists state that NASA is hiding the truth from us. They believe that the Face on Mars is key evidence for life on Mars, but if that was true NASA wouldn't hide it.

if they found life on Mars, NASA could get much more funding for their research. They would make millions of dollars out of it. If they had found spmething that intriguing, they wouldn't even think of keeping it a secret.

087f29f,"Dear State Senator,

Haven't you ever wondered why the poppular vote seems to have the majority of votes for a candidate? This due to the unfairness of the Electoral College. The Electoral College has to be eradicated mainly do to many factors such as the ""Disaster Factor,"" the Winner-Take-All"" system, and the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. These events can all cause a crisis in the country due the the Electoral Colleges unfairness.

One reason the the Electoral College can be considered unfair is due to something that we refer to as the ""disaster factor."" This is a possibility in which a state legislature is responsible for picking electors that vote based on their bias. This can be considered unfair mainly due to the fact that they did not follow their plegde to the citizens of their state. For Example, in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature choosed a group of electors in which the promised the people to vote for John F. Kennedy. In the end vote against Kennedy and not complying to their pledge. Luckily, Nixion, Kennedy's opponent, validated only his opponents electors, without establishing a precedent.

Technology is not valuabe for studnets expressions in classroms because a friend would know if you are down or happy or depressed the computer can't see tears on the inside they also don't know your life. An example is""a kid who is bi-polar they could be happy the one second,then boom anry the next second"".

Another example could be sometimes you just don't know if that person is sad,happy,angry and sometimes the kid doesn't wangt to talk about his or her emotions"". i believe this can prove that the computer doesn't know if the kid is happy or sad,but the friend will!

The use of technology can't read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom becaue the computer is not always correct about everything. An example is ""a game like NBA 2k18 they can scan your face,but it doesn't look just like you"". Another big example is ""the computer isn't always the right answer just like the internet the answer doesn't always come out right so the computer won't get your emotional feelings right.""

Another reason the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom isn't valuable because a lid could look angry but is actually happy. an example is ""sometimes i look angry but tkats just my normal face,so the computer would say i'm angry when i'm really happy"". Another examle is ""a kid could have a dissorder on his or her expression so once again the internet is wrong"". this proves that the computer cannot read the emotional expressions of students in class.

even today venus still has some features that are analogous to earth it even incudes valleys moutains. There might be more stuff that is on earth that looks like venus that we may not have seen because we could not properly explore it becuse of the distance.

Another reason that exploring venus is not such a bad idea is because you might learn new things on that plant that could help our plant out. Plus pople will alway have curiosity to learn how venus is if it will ever be a subsitute for earth. poeple want to explore it so bad becuse it is a hard challenge but it should not be discoraged jsut because it is dangerous.

POLUTION.

There are some up and downs to faster transportation for example, time  management we get tomplaces in one-third of the time we would if we would go walking to our destination. We wouldn't be freezing when it's called and sweating when it's hot. The down information is that the government waste a lot of money on gas, and car prices, even on fast food resturants. The truth is we dont even need cars, we WANT cars we don't NEED cars, theres a difference of the words and there meanings. For example in the story In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, studies show that 70% of Vauban's families do not own any type of veicles, and 57% sold their veicle just to move there. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two.

Polution...... It kills the earth and infact us aswell very slowly. Each year the government has to waste thousands of dollars to keep producing greenhouses because the use of any type of veicle is monumentous. If we keep doing what we doing there won't be an earth to live on at all. Cars aren't the only thing to blame for polution, we also have to blmame HUMANS, they know using a veicle too much consists on the consumption of gas which creates polution, but they still go out and drive for hours and hours just wasting there whole intire tank of gas. For example 50% of all cars inEurope (which is half of all people with any type of car) produce fuems, (polution) that require our government to develope greenhouses, which waste money aswell.

If we spend all day driving, we let out into the atmosphere some toxic fuems that kills the earth and us aswell. Then making the government waste money to make greenhouses to try to at least advance humans lives for a couple more hundreds of years. Up to 50% of car-intensive ares in America, are to blame for the development of greenhouses, stated in the article called In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars.            ",3
088fd5c,"When you turn sixteen, you're filled with anticipation and anxst of getting your liscence, and furthermore a car! I know, I have certaintly been there. But, what's so good about getting a car? Well, other than the new found sense of freedom. Not much. Car usage has accelerated since the 1900's and is starting to gradually decline. Why? Less stress, less pollution, and more excerise. These things alone may not be enough to convince you, so let's jump into the facts.

First off, getting rid of that car in your driveway will greatly lower your stress. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"""". When you think about it, it truly makes sense. When you have a car you have to worry about gas prices, payments, and fixes. But, when you live a car free life none of that is of your concern. So, therefore your stress decreases and your happiness can go up to an all time high. When you have one less bill each month it truly does leave an impact.

Secondly, we have a big issue that is in our hands... Pollution and smog. Who's fault is it? Ours. Fumes and smoke crowding into our atmosphere with no where else to go. Our cars are a huge part of it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed"" in France for their smog layers. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" We need to put a stop to this. It is destroying our planet. It will continue to destroy it until we make a change and do something to make this stop. It's in our hands and we can't just let it go. The problem will not just go away. It will not just fix itself.

When you are living in this day in age many people have cars, so they have no need to go out and walk, or skate, or bike anywhere because they have a more ""efficiant"" way of transportation. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,"" This means that people would be getting up and active to get to work and other places that they may need to be. Helping our environment and themselves.

Furthermore, cars are slowly but surely being forgotten, people are stopping their use of cars and taking alternative transportation. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling."" So, it's not as big of a deal as it used to be. Not everyone needs or wants to have a car anymore. ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for the carbon emmissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" When you decide that you don't want a car, you're benefiting from it and the future is benefiting from it. Taking the next step seems a bit out of reach but we can make it.

In conclusion, people see cars as something that is a must have. Or, a next step in their freedom. But, we can change that. Show the world that it is more harmful than helpful. ""One small step for man, a leap for mankind."" We can get there, but it takes more than one person to set down the keys. Reduce your stress, reduce the pollution, and increase your happiness. All it takes is one person to start a movement.    ",4
0890d0b,"The the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" display both positive and negative aspects about driverless cars. Everyone looks foward to the feature because of new technology that could make life easier but we really dont think about the bad that can come from these new divices. In my personal opinion I think that the negative aspects outweigh the positive aspects when it comes to driverless cars.

Even though driverless cars can possibaly be good for the economy because they use half the fuel of today's taxis they also have a large amount of cons that many people don't ever think about because they are blinded by the fact that these cars can basically get you where you need to go with little to no assistance from you, the manually driver. Even though driverless cars can get you where you need to go with hardly no assistance from you there will also be times when they do need your assistance, like if there is a accident or when there are road closes ahead. Although the car can alert you will you be to destracted by other things, such as cell phones, to pay attention to the signals that the car is giving you? Many drivers are probably more likley to to get bored while they are waiting for their turn to drive and this can result in accedents or something of that nature becaue you, the destracted driver, has missed the warning signales that the car is giving off to you.

Also people look at the aspect that just because they might be saving money by getting these cars because they will save money on gas and think that they are getting a better deal. But however, these cars are basically computer cars and if there is a problem with electrical pieces in the car it could be very pricey. Also since these cars are besically ran off of these computers that means of a part if messed up th car will not function properly.

Even though these cars can possabily be safer for the public when it comes to drunk drivers, what if these cars have a malfunction or technical diffuclitys? That could also be very harming to the public and you. If these driverless cars has a malfunction it could also put your life in danger along with the other people around you.

In conclusion, driverless cars has its pros and cons but when you actually think about it, the cons outweigh the pros. Just because you have this driverless car does not make you anymore safer than a person with a non driverless car. Just like regular cars, driverless cars has cons to it as well. Driverless carscan have expensive repairs and malfunctions just like regular cars can have. In my opnion driverless cars can have just as big of a risk as regular cars do. ",4
0890e40,"So ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a great little short story that includes very interesting facts and it's all on how to go about studying the planet Venus despite the dangers. That's not even half of it either in other words let me give you some knowledge that I have gained from this wonderul author.

And this is where I'll tell you about the why scientists are still discussing further visits to the planet, so it say's in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that it once long ago may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system then also Venus still today has a surface of rocky sediment besides that includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters fun fact Venus is called our ""Sister Planet"".

Now let's go to some of the reason's why human-beings aren't able to survive on Venus basically the story say's venus average temperatures are on average eight-hundred fahrenheit,the atomspheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience from here on earth there for as you can see the conditions are too extreme for humans to survive on the planet.

Furthermore let's talk about how NASA plans to study Venus. So NASA's solution is like imagin a bimp-like vehicle hovering thirty-plus miles above Venus to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up there, but it doesn't mean it's not going to hot it will be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and thje air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Finally for this conclusion I will just voice my own opinon about the short story on ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the thing I liked about the story is that it wasn't that hard to break everything down in to a little essay but besides that it was good and very informational story. I loved it!      ",3

089a7f7,"You ever been with someone that thinks something true but really not. Well I have. And one thing that people think is real is the face on Mars was created by aliens. But clearly the face is natural landform. So today im going to give three reasons why the face on Mars is a natural landform on Mars.

Well the first reason the face on Mars is just natural landform because people have checked back since to see more evidence. For example on April 5,1998 Mars Global Surveyorflew over Cydionia. Michale Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera team took a picture ten imes better than the viking photos. Than they put the picture on the web whene revealing a natural landform. No alien monument after all but even after that people still wasn't satisfied enough so sooner or later they did it again.

So on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor went close to Mars for a second look . They rolled the spacecraft25 degrees to the center of the face in the field of veiw. Then Malin team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera maximum resolution. Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best1976 viking photo. You can see in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixek size. So if thats the case if there was any objects like spaceships on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks we could see what they are.",3
089aae3,"You should join Seagoing Cowboys program! You might be thinking right now well why should I join this program? You should join because UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care or the horses, young cows, and mules that where shipped overseas. Its a important job to take care of the animals there our resource! You get to see and vist amazing places! And when you are in the program you get to help people out and help them recover. Its a good and nice thing that you are helping people out.

In the book ''A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'' A character from that book name Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime! In 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries where left ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).

Then in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14. Luke then says,''the day the Pacific war ended.''

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Then Luke was on a cattle-boat trip, they told Luke to just keep doing that for Luke's service. Luke was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. For Luke the cattle-boat trips where unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says.

Besides Luke helping people, he had side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special for Luke. And Luke got to go to a gondola ride in Venice , Italy,a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Maybe if you Join the Seagoing Cowboys program you can experience all these wonderful places like Luke did! And you can be helpful in this program.

On Luke second trip, he had to serve as night watchman. And his job was to check on all the animals every hour. Now, thats a tough job to do. But Luke was helpful and he did his job and he loves his job he does. To sum things up the jobs sometimes be a little hard to do but Luke never gave up on his job! So this is why you should join the program and help people out like Luke and Don did.",2

089e8f5,"All I am imagining is a lot of arguements and court cases on drivers getting angry with manufactures, and manufactures getting fighting back, claiming it is not their fault. If driverless cars are introduced to the rest of the world, there will me so many accidents and court cases that will be very tricky, because no one knows who is at fault. I believe that driverless cars are not reliable, at least not yet, and I know that I would not use a driverless car unless there are a lot of improvements made.

Sometimes machines just shut down and stop working for no apparent reason. Sometimes there are problems with robotic things that no one knows why the problem is occuring. In paragraph 2 it explains that, ""they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This shows that the cars, at least not yet can work all on there own. The driver still has to be alert and watching the road at all times, because at anytime the car could see something that it does not think it could handle, so the driver has to be ready at any time to step in and be ready to take over. Then again, machines sometimes have problems that just occur for no apparent reason, so maybe the car could just shut down and might not alert the driver so then right away there is a risk of a crash. Who then is at fault. In paragraph 9, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" If this happens who is to blame? The driver was told that they would be alterted when something the car couldn't handle occurs, but if the driver isn't alerted, then it must be the manufactures fault. But wait, the manufacurers made it clear thar the driver still has to be watching, and if they were not, then again, who is to blame? There are so many questions that either can't be answered, or take a lot of time to figure the answer out.

I personaly would not even think about using a driverless car until the manufactures figure out all the problems with the safty issues. It is not just the car itself that there needs to be work done on, according to paragraph 9, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" There are so many laws that would have to change and be made. So even if there are improvement on the car itself there are still also so many other things that you have to consider when thinking of using a driverless car.

I don't know after reading this passage, if I would ever really feel safe trusting a machine with my life and even of those around me. There are so many issues still that need to be fixed before I would consider testing one out. I need to make sure that myself and those around me would be safe if something were to go wrong with the car. Driverless cars are a new and interesting idea, but they need a lot of work to be done on them before they would be safe enough to be introduced to the rest of the world.",4
08a4217,"I don't know if you know know who I am but, I am Luke Bomberger. I have been on a ship for many years now. You should ride a cattle-boat too. A cattle-boat is a boat that carries animals across sea. When I was younger I helped my aunt Katie with her farm, that helped me prepare for the dangers that life holds.

Even though there are dangers at sea, I still like it. I am very happy while I am on this boat. It is an opportunity of a lifetime. ""I am grateful for the opportunity."" I said back in the 1900s. I was told by a captain to keep doing cattle-boating for my service. Your friends could help you become a cattle-boater. My friend helped me. By participating in cattle-boat, you could learn about other people and their needs. You could also learn about more cultures.

You may not think this a great ""job"" in all but actually, it kind of is. You do not know what is going to come at you. It's like a total suprise! You could be the driver of the boat, you could watch over the animals like me, you could do all sorts of things! We'll make sure you get fed. Who knows maybe you could even end up being the captain of the ship. That would be cool considering you just got here. You may think this is a joke but it's actually not.

There are a lot of men and women on this ship with the animals. You could be one of them, and who knows, maybe you'll try it and like it as much as me. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" When my friend asked me to go with him, I couldn't say no because I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Maybe you will have one of your friends come up to you an ask you to go to another country with them and away from your family. Maybe, you'll even say yes.

If you do go anywhere, tell me and I'll give you all the hints I know. Be careful though, the sea is dangerous. There have been a few ship-wrecks here and there. But not for a while. You are going to need a couple essentials: blankets, pillows, extra clothes, food, water, shoes and that is pretty much all you need for this boat ride. Have a good time! ",3
08a4c92,"What if there was a program that helped countries around the world? There is and it's called the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is amazing and I know because I was in it. By the time I was 18, I made nine trips with the Seagoing Cowboys program. I'm Luke Bomberger and here are reasons why you should join this program.

The first reason why you should join this program is you can see lots of amazing sites. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece, which I thought was special. In Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, I got to take a gondola ride. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Also, you should join because you get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. That's how they started the Seagoing Cowboys so that they could take care of animals. When I went the first time, there was a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. If you like animals, there's one more reason to join.

Another reason you should join is because of what happened during World War 2. What happened during that war was that countries were left in ruins. I went and trust me, this really changes the way you think about other countries and the world.

This is my favorite reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys, the fun games during the trip. We used to always play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would also have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. I have to say that they were awesome and helped time pass by.

The final reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it can open up your world like it did to me. I used to work at a bank and a grocery store and I never expeced this to happen to me. I'm grateful for the opportunity because it made me more aware of other peoples lives and what they and their country need to continue thier lives. Now, that awareness is still with me and I lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Take it from me, being a Seagoing Cowboy is awesome and helps you learn about the countries around the world. You can see and do cool things and make a difference in a persons life and a countries life. You should agree with the reasons why I said to join the Seagoing Cowboys because I went and joined and it changed my life. That's why you need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.",4
08a5c68,"Cars have helped people over the years, but has it helped the enviorment or your heath. When driving a car, the car releases gases that can effect the air around us. There are advantages of limiting the use of cars, like a heathier enviroment and a heathier body.

One advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier enviroment. When you are driving a car the gas in the car, is let out into the air. The gas that gose in the air can effect the air and plants around us, as it can turn to toxic. As the source Elisabeth Rosenthal explains, 50 percent of the greenhouse gases are caused by car-intensive areas in the United States. The gas from are cars are not just effecting are air, there effecting are greenhouse to. The source Robert Duffer tells us, how paris banded using cars after days of near-record pollution to clear the air. After days of no cars the air was clear again. As you can tell, limmiting car uses will help the enviroment alot.

Forthermore, Another advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier body. Instead of just siting in a car you can ride a bike,walk or roller skate. Also all those gases from the car wont be going in your body, effecting your insides. As the source Andrew Selsky explains, in Colombia on free car day the people hicked,skated and bicked to get where they need to go, instead of using a car. Without a car to take you places you will get exercie, which will give you power and engery for your body. A normal person should also exercise for 30 mintes a day. Also as Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us without a car you have less stress and are able to relax more. Cars can cause people alot of stress, and a alot of stress is not good for your body. Limiting the use of cars has a great effect on your heath.

Conslusion, Limiting the use of cars will have the advantages of a heathier enviroment and a heathier body. The enviroment and your body is a big thing in your life, so you would want to do whatever possible to keep it heathy. So instead of talking the car try to walk or ride a bike next time.    ",4

08b1777,"Driverless cars are a good idea, but it has its flaws. Driverless are more prone to get into an accidents than cars with people actually driving them. First, the car is made up of a lot of sensors. The sensor on the roof is the most important one, and if that sensor gets damaged in any way the car couldn't drive itself. If someone was taveling on the road in that car, and the Rotating sensor stopped working then they would have to take over , and drive themselves. Also if a malfunction happened on a highway it can cause car crashes and such. While there are problems about the sensor privacy needs to be addressed too.

Privacy is a big thing too the ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining foucused on the road"" this shows that the manufactureres are watching people as they drive. People in the car would have no privacy cause the manufacturers are watching them. While privacy is a issue buying that can't drive itself is an issue too.

The car still ""requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" this shows that the driver must stay alert while its driving. Manufactueres have developed things to get people's attention whenever a problem occurs. Its like why would you pay for a driverless car that you still have to drive?

Driverless cars should not be sold because there are to many flaws with them from malfunctioning to broken sensors. Its better to have it be human driven than machine driven.    ",3
08b8798,"Aliens creating human faces on mars? That's just carzy. The face on mars is just a natural landform, and here's why. There is picture proof and now, there is better technology so we can see things way beter now than we did before.

First, the picture proof. Pictures were taken, very clearly and sharp showing it's just a natural landform. The picture that was tooken actually was more than ten years later, so of course there was better cameras getting it in clear picture it's pretty obvious what it actually is. Even years after that another picture was tooken and showed it with even better quality, prooving that is no alien creation.

Next reason is, we live now in a better world with better technology and we can do new things. So a picture was taken on a cloudless day of the face. This time we zoomed in and each pixel inside the

picture spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Why this is important is now we can take a picture and get a closer look and not make it much blury, back then zooming in was not so good making it closer but really blury. So maybe if you zoomed in back then it would be blurry and look probably more like and alien artifact, but now zooming in actually works better and more efficiently making it easy to see it's a natural landform.

Finally, we come to conlusion. Even though you can argue and say ""The picture was taken on a cloudy day and the alien marks are coverd by haze."" We can come back and say ""The pother picture was taken in summer on a cloudless day"". And there were no alien symbols to be found. Basically the face is a natural landform, and there are the facts to back it up. ",3

08c6a31,"Using the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classroom. Many students often get bored, distracted, or just lose focus when being taught a lesson that doesn't interest them. Of course you can't just not learn the lesson, since you are learning because it will come to use later on. Therefore, I believe that with help from your computer screen, you could stay on track with your work.

Often times, teachers use different teaching styles based on what allows their students to learn most effectively. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers could do so, too. For example, say you're reading an excerpt on the computer and it's not really on a topic that interests you, most students would immediately lose attentiveness to the reading. This is not a good thing, especially if the information was important, useful, or for a grade. But, with the Facial Action Coding System, this problem could be solved. The system could be used to spice up the learning, or keep the teaching style stays the same way if the student is staying attentive.

Many people learn in a different way. Some students are more effectively taught by learning visually, others hands-on, and some verbally. The Facial Action Coding system could recognize these based on students facial expressions. If the student is looking focused while seeing a diagram, the system could see they're a visual learner, and keep teaching the topic in that way. Otherwise if that doesn't work, the system could see if the student's emotions would change based on if they could listen to the information instead of reading.

Based on the positive characteristics of the Facial Action Coding System, I believe we should have the technology at school. The system could really be put to use, especially if it could help students learn and understand topics in an easier way. The emotion reading technology would be extremely valuable to have in a classroom.   ",4
08cd1b8,"Today my fellow college showed me a picture of mars that was taking back in 1976. He said ""it was created by aliens"" but I didnt belve him because they are not real . So therefore I asked him what is the picture and he replied to me ""a face of god"" and I simply laughed at him, because there are not aliens so they could not of made that, and I laughed at him again because god is not real so they wouldnt know what he looks like . Then I left because I had plans tonight and I needed to get ready. A week goes by and he calls me and says that I need to come down to he lab asap. When I got there the picture of gods face was on the screen and he told me NASA had went out to mars and got a better picutre of the face with better pixels . I said "" that can not be the same picture and face 25 years ago . But I was wrong it was a different picture but the same face . NASA went out and got a whole new picture .I thought to my self well how can that be , mars has 100's of storms a day, how has it not been destroyed. Well I came to relize that my friend was right , that was a picture of mars with gods face on it . But when i called nasa they said that its classified so i couldnt have any info on it . So I dug deeper into it and NASA thinks that it is a egyptian pyramid. but i still dont belive thats its from aliens

. But as the years go by , maybe something else will pop up and I might belive in aliens",1
08cdf6e,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood. Being able to see and recognize more emotions for peers. Lastly it can help the user better ""communicate"" with the computer. ",5
08cec1d,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states very clearly how beneficial studying Venus would be, despite all the dangers. Even after learning how harsh the conditions are on ground level, for some reason, the author still believes the danger would be worth it. Though my own opinion may vary from the author's, they still give very convincing reasons for their point of view. According to the article, the main two reasons Venus would be beneficial for humans to study would be the amount of information that could be learned about the landscape of Venus millions of years ago, and to satisfy human curiosity while having the satisfaction completing a challenge we have been faced with for centuries.

Though the author gives several convinving reasons for studying Venus, perhaps the most influential would be the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus. In paragraph four, the author discusses that Venus displays several features similar to Earth, meaning it is possible Venus used be a whole lot like Earth. As stated directly in paragraph four, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" Solely based off the information provided in this quote, the author has already begun to convince me learning more about Venus might actually lead to some pretty extraordinary discoveries. What this quote is saying is millions of years ago Venus may have been the planet with the most liveable conditions...instead of Earth. If scientists were able to discover this much, just imagine all the other life forms and food webs that could be uncovered. To reinforce their opinion on Venus potentislly being liveable in the past, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can cometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" at the end of paragraph four. What the author is saying in this quote is at this point, all we have to do is find out how to brave the conditions of Venus. As for travel time, Venus is practically our neighbor, so no worries there.

A secondary reason the author provides as to why humans should study Venus is to satisfy human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task that has troubled humans for centuries. The author states this idea in paragraph eight when saying, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" In this quote, the author is saying due to the fact that humans are extremely curious, we will likely find ourselves in a predicament with similar tough challenges in the future, so we may as well begin working through some of them now. When one sets out to complete a task, they should not stop halfway, but follow through until the problem is solved. They also should not quit because they believe the challenge is too hard. If one is able to stick with their guts and do what needs to be done, they will reap the benefits. Whether those benefits be winning a tough volleyball match or finally sending a human to Venus, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that we do not stop believing in ourselves and our ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible.

In conclusion, the author has given many, specifically two, very convincing reasons as to why we should continue to study Venus. The main two reasons are the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus, and satisfying human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task which has troubled humans for centuries. Based on the authors suggestions on why humans should continue to study Venus, I have considered changing my mind and agreeing that the dangers would be worth it. It is important to have knowledge about the past of our solar system, and it would be very interesting to know if Venus was once able to support various forms of life. I also feel that the author made a good point in stating that we are already this far into studies, so we should not give up now. Humans are always going to be insatiably curious, so by not finding a solution to this problem now, we are just placing this challege upon the generation following us. After all, curiosity technically never killed the cat. ",4
08d4d59,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tells the reader about the challenges that there are for exploring Venus. It also talks about reasons why reseachers and scientist should not give up on the exploration of Venus. In the passage, the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how the trip could be made safer, the technology that can be used, and the value of exploring the planet.

The author supports the idea that Venus is worth exploring by explaining and giving examples on how travelling to Venus could be made safer. In the article, it says ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" In other words, this proves how the trip to explore Venus can be made more safer. Furthermore, the author supports his idea by giving examples and explaining how the exploration of Venus can be safe.

Another way the author supports his idea is by explaining the techonlogy that can be used to explore Venus. In paragraph 7 of the article, it states ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This shows how this type of technology can be used for the further exploration of Venus.

Lastly, another way that the author supports his idea is by explaining what the value would be if humans explore Venus. In the last paragraph of the article, it says ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" It also states ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This proves what the value of exploring Venus would be for humans. In other words, the author supports his idea by explaining the opportunities and values of exploring Venus.

Furthermore, the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the travel safety, the technology that can be used, and the value of exploring Venus. The technology that humans have right now can bring so many opportunities, such as exploring new planets. These opportunities should be used now and not be on hold. ",4
08d9638,"Driverless cars sound like something that you could only see in a Si-Fi movie. They are here to chang the world and trying to make it a better place. Driving makes a hug impact in the human life. Ever since the first car was invented, humans have had to travel in a shorter way. The transportation way is heading a new direction since techology is improving we can see the difference bewteen the first car to a car that could be able to drive by itself.

Having a future where no body has to drive a car by themselves sounds pretty impresive. But you also have to think about what could those types of cars can give us and make our lifes better. These new inventions have not all been successful, but the companies making them are making progress by finding new ways to make these types of cars go more then just a small traveling distance and then stop. In my point of view these cars could actually give us the chance of not having to stop for a rest when you're tired, watch movies or televison shows while your car is still running. They could save us from spending so much money on gas and some could be safe for the enviroment.

Companies such as Google, have had cars that could be drive independently under specific conditons since 2009. There have been cars that have drove more then just a few miles with out even causing an accident. Cars that are truly driverless may help dealing with complicated traffic issues.Not only are they working on Smart cars but also smart roads.In order for the car to travel where you would like to go, they might develop a system where the road could have a binary code in order for the car to remember the places you travle to.

The car would really have to be smarter for those types of ideas, they have worked with a lot of people to have a clear view of what the car could look and drive like. Every car needs ways to protect the passengers. And so automakers find new ways to prevent accidents incase they every happen with these types of cars. Automakers are continuing their work on the ways there could be a car that has all the abilities of having good safety measures and having the ability to drive on there own.",4
08dab5c,"First of all I will agree with the development of driverless cars. As we all know that the technique is improving, the new technique is shows the good way of them to serve us. The driverless cars is one of these new techniques.

The driverless cars will help us by a lot of different ways. For example, the driverless cars will improve the safety of cars, it can let the drivers have time to sleep in the long-term travel, it also can help old man or childern to drive. The car will be really helpful, it will be more popular than the old car than we are using now.

If the technique of driverless cars improved and don't need human driver anymore. That's a good news for old people or childern. Because they don't need to drive at all, the computer will fix all of the problems.

In the article it talking about the driverless car is still waiting for the Law. There are a few states is allowing the driverless car. That is a good start, in the future there will be more states and more counties allow the driverless car.

The article also talking about the driverless car's bad way. It's still not really safty yet. I know the driverless car is not safety yet. But we should give the driverless car some time to improve. I believe in the future the Driverless car will be more safty than normal cars. Because the normal cars are contrl by humans, humans will make mistakes. For example, in the long term drive the driver will be really sleepy or maybe the driver will take a phone call when he is in the driving. But the computer will not be tired, so it is better than the human drivers. But we should give them some time to improve the driverless car.

The technique of the driverless car still imporving now. I think the technique will be progress and become well-done some day. At that time the technique have already grow up and it will be a lot save than human control cars.Maybe now the driverless car are still have a lot of questions but in the future the driverless car will be more safty, more common and more confutable. So I think the Driverless cars will have a great development in the future.",3
08dac82,"Driverless cars should not be allowed to be manufactured in any states or in any countries in the world. Driverless cars could cause conflict after an accident occurs. These cars could make drivers not pay attention to what´s going on around them more than they don´t pay attention now. These cars could also make driving boring.

First off, these driverless cars could cause major conflict after an accident occurs. Who is at fault during an accident? The manufacturer of the car or the driver that just wasn´t paying attention to the road or anything surrounding them? Second, these driverless cars could make people too lazy to pay attention to anything because they would think that since the car is driving itself, everything will be fine and that everything is under control. Next, these cars would have traffic laws and safetly laws would have to be changed in a nig amount of significance. There are only 4 states that allow semi-autonomous cars because the other states are still concerned about safety. Lastly, these cars would make driving boring. Who would want the car driven by itself while the driver is just waiting for a time to have to take over and take control of the car? Where is the fun in driving if you are not even doing it?

Therefore, these driverless cars should not be allowed to be manufactured or driven. These cars could just make driving boring and dangerous. These driverless cars could also cause many conflicts and changes with the law.              ",3
08dcd91,"Current education in schools are based on standardlized education with all student having simmilar classes, even if student are confused or bored with class. Which could cause more possibility to fall credits. Because of these problems, the recognizing emotional expressions of student by computer are valuable to prevent left behind than other students.

The emotion recognition technology could bring more computer based education with more personalized class even if one of the student are confused or bored. According to Professor Thomas Huang, from Beckman Institite for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, this technology brings ability to ""Classroom computer could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""Modify the lesson, like an effective human instuructor"". Computer emotion recognition techology could bring more ability to make class attractive and prevent student from falling their grades and credits or even giving advanced education for each person.

Also, faking emotion recognition technology is difficult. According to ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if someone is trying to fake smile, ""mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius"" which makes sytem to recognize false smile. From this technology, with educatuional purpose such as recognizing emotional expressions to prevent left behind student, this will give another creditbility to system even if student tried to deny their actual feelings, such as confuse.

The emotion recognizing software would be valuable to prevent many student from falling grades. The facial recognization have some of problems such as teachers could be easily unempolyed, or privacy problem.

08e4b2e,"I believe the Face on Mars is actually a natural landform. Even though the face does resemble something created by aliens, I still think that it is natural. I will show you why I believe that this is just a landform, and not a face created by aliens.

I believe the Face is a natural landform because scientists believe that the face resembles landforms around the American West. One scientist said that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also, the scientist added that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.

Scientists can be wrong sometimes though. However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.

In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.

This tells you why I believe that the Face is fake and is actually a basic landform. Even though the Face does look like aliens made it, it is more likely that it is a natural land form. These facts prove that the Face is not alien made.",3

Not most people have vehicals because of the payment range and if we can change that who knows we might not have to have buses, taxi, etc any more, and the people will have more money to take care of their children and its also gonna help with car crashes and lowering how many we have every year or so. Allowing kids16+ to drive the less crashes will help majorly. Also with the insureance itll cost less but will the insurance go out of buisness ?

She nows walks verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. in 2006 Vauban completed, this is an example of growign trend in Europe, the united States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, this is a movement of ""smart planning."" The advantage is you will have more access to public transportation, a disadvantage is if you live far from public places then you might have to walk or take a bus.

In Paris they have enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). Nearly 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesels engines int he rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. The advantage of not having a car is that you wouldn't be spending money on gas, the disadvanteage is that you will be fined. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made fro plug-in cars, hybirds, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. After the smog ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. There is alot of disadvantages because would you have a work day on Tuesday and you have an odd numbered plate.

BOGOTA,Colombia- In a program that sets to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tooked buses to work during a car-ffree day yesterda, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This was their third staright year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal was to promote alternative  transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. In Bogota there were occasional rain showers . Some thought it was a good idea some not so much. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress in lower air pollution,"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many countries have tried having a car-free day, and many succeeded. For the Unoted States President Obama ambitious goal was to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assit from incipient shift in American behavior. The studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

So driving with a car or not it either good or bad because not driving could give you the excerise and driving just means you like your personal things.

With there own proof. Once I would get a response, I would tell them there isn't much proof that aliens exist. Including, that there are also no signs of life on Mars.

Also, I would also state that the Face was only a natural landform of a mesa, made by natural causes on planet Mars. It was probably most likely made by a sandstorm. But, surely not made by an alien. I would also tell the person who I am arguing with, that aliens are just fictional characters in movies, book, etc. made up by normal people.

Another important reason thhat you can tell that the Face on Mars is only a landform is that in the pictures show, the face has more features as a normal mesa. And you can tell because of the more advanced technology to improve the photos shown. With that reason you would point out how the face has revalent features of a landform. To prove that statement in the text, it states that the landorm just appears as an Egyptian Pharaoh face because of the shadows on Mars.

08f5a36,"Driverless cars, although dangerous in a multitude of ways, have uses that far excede any dangers. It is said that in order to progress in life you must first take steps back. Although these driverless cars are a step forward in technology, they can be seen as a being a step backward because of the dangers that persist. In reality, these dangers are just a learning curve to arguably one of the most revolutionary inventions in the last decade, driverless cars. These cars are very fesable because they are sought after, the technology is available, and they are getting safer with time.

These driveress cars are some of the most sought after technology that has entered this world. The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,"" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality.

Not only are they sought after by millions, but the technology for these driverless cars is available and has been available. Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars.

The one thing that people can control about these cars is their safety. This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive.

The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out. Driverless cars are no longer a thing of the future but make up our present in every way imaginable.",5
08fa0b3,"When we use facial expressions it lets the person you are directing the expressions to know how we are feeling. We smile because we are happy, we frown because we are sad, we raise our eyebrows because we are shocked or surprised. We use usually identify those pretty well, but a computer can identify them better. I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.

When I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.

Students get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them. They want something that will entertain them and help them learn at the same time. With this new technology, student's facial expression will be identified when they like or don't like something. Teachers then can change the way the lesson is taught without changing the lesson at all as told in paragraph 6.

This is a new way to change how schools teach. More students would want to come to school and teachers would have an increase in successful students. Knowing what we didn't know is creating more ideas to the future. ",3
08fb0fb,"I am Luke Bomberger and I just graduated from High school and had two part time jobs. One was at the bank and another at the grocery store. One day my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to go to Euroope on a cattle boat, and I could not resit it.

It was 1945 and World War two had just ended and the UNRRA joined together and helped the coutries to recover from the war. UNNRA hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the cattle that were shipped over seas. Don and I signed up to do this position. In August we got orders to go to New Orleans. I had 335 horses that I had to take care of.

After about two weeks we finally arrived, but caring for the animals kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered at least two or three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be dragged from the lower holds of the ship and the stalls had to be cleaned out. I had helped out at my aunt? farm when I was younger but I was not prepared for the dangers on the sea. On my second trip I was going to go make my hourly report to the captain and I slid down a slippery ladder. A small metal strip had stopped me from going into the dark atlantic, but I was not able to work for a couple days because my ribs were cracked.

This job kept me very busy, and had many oppertunities to see things I have never seen before. I halso had found some times that I could have fun on board instead of having to care for the animals. After the animals would be dropped off we would head back. We played all kinds of activites and games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in empty places were the animals were. We also had table-tennis tournoments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, the games had help pass time.

I encourage ever teenager if you have an opputunity, to sign up for this job. This job I was able to see things I had never seen, it was a lifetime experience, and I was able to stay busy with the animals and then have a little fun. I encourage this job because this is what I did it was an enjoyable jod. I mean how cool is it to ride a ship and take care of cattle. Then after they get unloaded you can even have some fun on the ship. It helped me become more aware of other countries and their needs.   ",2
08fbb47,"Is it possible to be too passionte about something? This author wrote an entire article on how challenging but worth it, it would be to visit Venus' crtiical atmosphere. How well does the author describe, or explain, their own opinion? They support this idea very thoroughly by these three things: The idea that life could have lived there before, the conditions are inhumane, and the fact that it could gain insight and can settle our curiosity.

To start, the idea that at one point in time there has acutally been life living on that planet is crazy. In paragraph four, it talks about how at on point there may have been big oceans like that are similar to the ones on earth. We think this because there are many rocky surfaces, such as valleys, mountains, and craters, that can only be formed from water eriodication. When you even look at it, it just look earth like. Obviously it has changed over the years but you can't rule it out. Is it possible there were living things on this planet at once?

Secondly, now the conditions are inhumane. How did they get that way? Paragprah three is all about what it is like on Venus. The temperatures now rise over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The air is absolutely unbreathable as it is made up of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Not only is there carbon dioxide floating around in the air, the atmosphere is mostly made up of sulfuric acid which is very toxic to be breathing in that much. The air pressure on Venus is ninety times deeper, or stronger, than the bottom of sea level. If we even tried ot land on Venus none of the metals would last in eight-hindred degrees. There are also many impediments such as erupting volacnos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting. Minus all these problems we would have to find a way around, the author believes that it is still worth it to visit Venus.

Lastly, we would gain so much insight and our curioustiy could be settled. Paragraph eight talks all about this and about how this could open the doors for us to learn new ideas and come up with new technology that could even help up here on Earth. They also state in paragraph eight to support the idea that despite Venus' risky conditions it would still make a worthy pursuit by saying, and I qoute, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Which I interpret as do not let these conditions scare us. We are so smart and we can be creative and find a way around all of these 'problems'.

In conclusion, how opinionated and factual can someone be? How do you know to balance these two things? At times we have to be one-hundred percent curious about what we are writing about because you don't want to write an article on something you don't care about or find important. Overall, how detailed and opionated was the author? In the end, I think that the author did a great job at explaining why they think it would be a worthy pursuit. Do you?",5
0906ee2,"Your feeling ten percent annoyed, fifty percent boared, and thirty percent suprised. Advancements in technology has been brought to an entire new era with facial readers. One computer can tell people how they feel about themselves just by the muscel structure and movements in their face. Who would not want to know what some stranger walking down the street is feeling? I mean, I know I would. Today our generation is amoung the nosiest. Classrooms today need these computers to better understand their class. Emotional expressions can change society by understanding children, making lives easier, and progressing technology.

Children have mood changes as fast as people chose fast food over vegtables. Children are a hard age to understand what they are feeling, becuase they are so quick at changing the things they are doing and always moving. Having a brain wired to becoming board with something one day and then wanting to do it again the nest day. That is hard for teachers to keep up with. Dr. Huang commented, ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or board."" But, with having a computer that classifies the six basic emotions and picks up each one takes a great stress off of teachers. Teachers have a class from anywhere to ten to fourty students. Having to know each one personally and be able to read what they are thinking to help further their education is a big task for underpaid teachers to do. Those fourty students have all different facial structures and the Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track their movements and weight the different units. Teachers understanding their students better with the Coding System, will help them further their education in a classroom when seeing if they are frustrated or upset.

Fourty students, fourty diiferent views, and fourty different emotions. That is a lot to take in. Having the Coding System in your classroom takes the relief off the teachers of figuring out each student. With the easy three step process anyone can read their emotions, but just by video it makes it three steps easier. With no wires and personal information to plug in. Teachers have students that do not like to share their feelings, which takes a lot of time for the teacher to understand what they are feeling taking away from other students. Dr. Huang stated, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Saving the time of teachers and peronalizing lessons for the class creates so many benefits. Not having this machine will not do damage in hurting the students, it is helping them.

Fifty years ago classrooms did not even have a smart board or computer labs, they had chalk boards. It is a fact some people do not like change. Parents probably did not like their children learning how to use computers or new technology. But our world is advacing, and makes it that much amazing to see how simply technology is helping change classrooms for the better. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are developing ways for us and computers to communicate. People think that is scary and weird. The fact is, we can learn about the artwork from hundreds of years ago with the sytem. Classrooms can have precise and exact answers with the system. Huang used Mona Lisa and they figured out that she was 83 percent happy, and 9 percent disguested. Can your art teacher tell you that?

Technology is helping further our classrooms education and learn abilites.

Classrooms benefit from the Facial Coding System. Many people will be against this new change, but they have no arguement. The Facial Action Coding System is easy, helpful, and dependable. As a teacher I would feel more comfortable with giving a lesson and teaching views ,they all understood and agreed with. Lives can change by understanding childrens minds, creating hard ache free lives, and keeping up with the new technology. ",5
0909271,"So there was a time when Luke signed up to be a sea cowboy because he said it was an opportunity of a lifetime to do this journy. So if join this program than you will have the time of your life and you will probly will do the same things Luke did. Luke did many things like playing games with his friend or explore a little because when Luke did this he injoyed this journy.

Here is some more reasons you might want to join the program. So Luke went on a journy with his friend and there was 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed the horses. Luke was going to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Lukes favriot thing was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Luke also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Luke had a lot of work like clean the stables feed the horses two or three times a day. Luke also found time to have fun on borad, especiallyon the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. The world opened up for Luke.

So if you join this program you will have the time of your lives. You will get to visit diffrent places and see diffrent things like everything that Luke saw on his journy. You will get to play all types of diffrent games like every single game that Luke played with all the other cowboys. So if you join the world will open up to you like it opened up for Luke. So if you join I hope you have the best time of your life so you can injoy the world just like Luke.      ",2
090c52d,"In all honesty, if it were up to me, I would keep the Electoral College. Because imagaine what a catastrophe it would be if we did not have the Electoral College, how would they count the votes. Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,  once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner.

Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. Also, it is possible for worker of the Electoral College to make a mistake in countung the counting the votes and to cause a big confussion in the votes but that is very highly impossible, if not impossible.

If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place?

The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachrosim, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruledbydeclaring the candidate who receives the most popular vote the winner. Not only that, but a disputeover the outcome of an Elecotral College voteis possible-it happened in 2000-but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.

Their are five reasons to retain, or keep the Electoral College. First, it's a certainty of outcome, the winner is everybodys president, it swings states, not only does ig work for little states, but for big ones too, and you can avoid run-off elections.

So those are my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College, we should not overlook the goods that the Electoral College does to our nation just because of two little bad that can be repaired.                      ",2
0912e51,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !",2

0916c73,"The author states that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.Even though its dangerous the Astronomers are intreguied by the planet.

NASA is working on different projects to study venus. He also states that challenging to meet venus has a value to it. But visiting venus can be dangerous too.

In the article "" the challange of exploring venus"" The author describes

the planet venus as a ""evening star"" because it brights up since venus is close to the sun. Astronomers are integuiered by venus because it's not only close to the earth and sun, venus can be a earth lookalike because of it's features.In the article it states this "" the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains,and carters."" The author describes that venus can be like earth becuase of how both plantes have moutains and valleys. Another quote from paragraph 4 states that ' venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.. even though there could be a long time frame of space travel.""

Even though being able to visit venus is intresting

the plan on getting over there can take up days or even weeks.

The Author also states that the group

NASA has found ways to study the planet venus. For example using technology to study it. In paragraph 7 it says "" electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber of venus""s surface and it lasted 3 weeks."" This sentence states

that the group working on this project succeded into making a technology that lasts a long time to prove that it works. Another tech they could use is an old one that contributed in World War 2. That computer is powerful and flexible to manage instead of using wired up compueters."" sysytems that use mechanical parts can be made more resisting to heat."" Meaniing that this technology resists heat and scientist or Astronomers can study peacefully in a safe way therefore no one is in risks.

In advance to the challenges the author thinks that visiting venus is in great value. Why?because since venus has been more earth alike and NASA has been investigating new ideas to study the planet it brings it to be an interesting journey to take. In paragraph 8 it reads that "" huamn curiousity will likeky lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" The author is saying that the eager of the people to know about venus can raise to popularity. Author also says "" traveles should'nt let the doubts and danger expand to meet imagination and innovation."" The author doesn't want people to let the rumors or the challenges of doing something to stop them from adventuring.

Even though Studing venus or going up to space to visit venus is adenturing, Venus can also be dangerous for humans. In paragraph 3 it says "" Venus

has the hottest temperature that can cause earthquakes, erupting volanoes, and bad weather."" This could cause a huaman death because your headed to an envirement that has

high temperature and lightning strikes. also "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything huamns encounter of earth."" What this sentence is refferng to is that since we are not used to extreme heat, our bodies wouldn't be able to hamdle the heat.

Despite the danger that venus can be There is still ways to being able to study the planet Venus. As the author states that Atromomers are intrguied by it and NASA has safe ways of studying venus.Plus even the challenges of venus brings a good value.",4
0916f2c,"The Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to everyday school life. This computer system can help with several things from elementary school to college. This could also change the way the world works forever. The FACS can easily be an important part of our education society.

The first and most effective thing FACS would impact is student's attitudes in the classroom. If FACS was active on all of the students computers, it could detect their emotions to influence them to get back on track and focus. It could also simply just keep the concentration going about the lesson being instructed. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6) . This can improve the interaction in class and can also improve many students grades.

If FACS was implemented into schools, students would feel more involved in the lecture, and pay attention more while being extra alert. Students will also be more knowledegable due to the fact that they are taking in information and really getting to learn about it, instead of just trying to find the answers that will satisfy on a worksheet or test. While feeling more involved, alert, and learning a lesson with full attention, this will impact grades greatly. This will help even more students proceed on into the next step of education, which is college.

FACS would benefit in grade school and would most definitely continue to help students in college. College can get difficult, but FACS could influence to keep students focused when they seem to become overwhelmed by their expressions. If students are impacted by FACS when they are younger and proceed on to college while continuing their education, there then comes a career. FACS will help in high school to get you to a college of your dreams, also best fit for your major. Then in college, it will help you focus and be actively listening and learning about your major to help you find a career that best fits you and your abilities. If everyone could have the opportunity to have the career as what best suits them, they will have an easier life and being more helpful to the people around them.

If FACS started being used in elementary school, proceeded to middle school, and so on in high school; it will teach students the habit of fully paying attention in class and being active. It will improve grades greatly. It will also help college students stay focused, even when times seem to become difficult. They will also already be influenced to stay active and fully aware of the lesson in class. If a student has well listening skills and is knowledgeable of their major, they will find the best job for theirself. If more people began to find jobs that benefitted them, and they were happy doing it, it would impact more than just students, it would impact the whole world.             ",4
091a770,"The author very well demonstrates that the idea of studying Venus, despite the risks, should continue forward. The author mentions previous times where NASA has sent probes and such to Venus and explains the failures and why the probes don't survive the landing very long. When explaining the type of features Venus has, the author mentions that it has signs of physical features that Earth has right now. The author states that some of the familiar features are valleys, moutains, and craters and probably convered in oceans. A lot like Earth. By addressing the fact that Venus has signs of similar physcial features as Earth, the author makes the point that if we continue to study Venus we can learn more about Earth and what could possibly happen to Earth. It makes the reader more convinced to side with the author. The author also mentions how we could do missions while staying safe but still find out information about Venus. The author lists a danger then adds a way to avoid this danger and be safer which makes the point of continuing to explore Venus more appealing. For example, in paragraph 5 the author states the conditions of the atomosphere and land then gives the solution of hovering 30 miles off the ground of Venus. Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet. The author supports the idea of by conducting more studies and missions, it would further our knowledge about Earth very well. ",3
091a8ca,"Driverless cars seem to be the new thing now-a-days. Everyone wants one! I am totally up for the whole driverless car thing! I feel like if we had driverless cars that it would protect us so much better, it would be better for the earth, and the cars would get more gas mileage.

If we had driverless cars think about how much safer our world could be. Just think about it. Think about all the car accidents that happen all the time as a result of drivers simply not paying attention. Now, if we had driverless cars the number of accidents would go down by a whole bunch! Driverless cars have sensors everywhere on them, interior and exterior, that could keep people safe.

Driverless cars would be a lot better for the earth also. The reason why they would be better for the earth is because they do not have to burn as much gas, which means less pollution in the air.

The last way that driverless cars could benefit us is because driverless cars get way better gas mileage. In paragraph one the author says ""The cars Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

Driverless cars seem like such a good idea for this world! I'm sure everyone would love to have a car that they could feel ultimately safe in, that is better for the earth, and that gets better gas mileage. Because let's face it, no one likes to spend a whole lot of money on gas all of the time! These cars could literally help and improve all of our lives!",3
091e483,"I think that this technology would be good thing because, most kids don't share their emotion. If a computer can read how they are feeling, and can help them, it would be amazing. It would also be a little odd, but in the end I think it would be very positive.

Computers already can do a lot of things, such as playing games and looking up stuff on the internet. The text states ""Dr. Huang and his colleage are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"". If computers can now read human emotion, this will be the next level in technology.

Computers are very good at being accurate, like solving a math problem, and doing what they are programed to do. The text states ""...the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles"". This shows that the software will be very accurate, and very smart. This software and hardware will help so many kids.

Most human communication is nonverbal, so if we could have a computer that would read our emotions. That would be good for kids that are sad and dont want to talk about thier problems. The computer would help them to be happy. The text states ""So the cumputers need to understand that, too."" This shows that the computers would understand that it is communicating nonverbaly.

In conclution, I am for this technology. It would help kids get through their day, and help them become happy. They would also feel like they have a friend, that understands them. This will be the next big level in technology. Even though, it might be a little weird.        ",3
091eaf0,"Today in society we have alot of disagreements on which president should be elected on the day all votes are finally counted and the votes are tallied up to the final result of who is going to be our new president of the United States, but what is our system for doing this?

One way is

Electoral College,

Electoral college is a process consisted of thye selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the votes from congress. So if you think about it we are just electors for electors. This College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes can win the election for the President.

Under the Electoral college, voters dont vote for the president, they vote for state electors who in turn elect the president. There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. People want to have their vocies hear for the country they live in, they want an opinion that matters! You can't have that when someone else is speaking for you...    ",1
0926d5e,"""it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

(source 2 para. 14) But is it really? The Electoral College is why are nation is what it is. If we didn't have The Electoral College many of our great Presidents might not have been presidents. it's even under the 23rd amendment of the Constitution.

To begin with, their is a much less percentage of dispute between The Electoral College then their would be over the popular vote. for example, in 2012 election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and Romney recieved 51.3 percent of the popular vote. just imagine how differently our country would be if we had Romney as our president right now.

Also the Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, which means that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. in paragraph 22 it states the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balence that large states (population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constitution.

Even though the Electoral College is amazing and revolutionised The United States, ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of selectors, who in turn could elect the President."" (paragragh 10) so if you wanted to vote for Kerry you would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.

in conclusion, The Electoral College is a revolutionary thing that was created by the founding fathers and put into the constitution as the 23rd amendment. it is a easy process that has made the United States what it is today. some of our very own Presidents have won because of the Electoral college.                    ",3

I think that would be valuable in other situations, like for depressed people, or for like an aslyum to check how these people feel. I think that it would be a waste of money, it would be to much money for all the features to add. The passage said that it Facial Action Coding System would have to scan your face and i think that would be a lot of money for just making something that would be able to check how you feel. You could sell it to certain people that help people out with emotional things, so like they would scan their face in the begining to see how they feel, after the meeting they have the person in charge would have to scan their face to see if that meeting changed the way they felt from the begining. It would be good for certain uses but to have it in schools wouldn't really help. I think it wouldn't help in schools because i don't think people would just like it if you just had to scan there face to see how they feel, i think you have to ask them first and if they say yes you can see how they feel. I don't think we should have this around because there is really no need why you need to check how people feel if you don't know who they are. Even if they are just students doing what they need to do i don't think they would like people knowing how they feel, i know i wouldn't like people scanning how i felt if i don't know them because some people don't like people knowing the stuff they feel and how they feel unless you know them and can trust them.",3
092ff4e,"The advantages of limiting car is great because it helps the environment. Also you don't need a car because there's public transportation. Some would disagree but I belive it's good. This essay will be informing you the advantages of limiting your car usage. Also how walking, bicycling, and talking public transportation is better for you and others. Also how it is bad for enviroment and there will be less traffic for those people that hate traffic.

The number one advantage of limiting our car usage is because cars are really bad for the enviroment. While your driving your car you don't notice how bad it is for the enviroment. The gas that comes out your car causes smog; which is bad if you comsume it. ""...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (Source 2). China for example has a big popullation; so many people uses cars. The smoke that comes out makes the air so polluted it's bad for your health.

The second advantage is how walking and bicycling is better for you. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air popllution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicyle with his wife."" (Source 3). It would give people the time to take a break from everything else and enjoy life more. People would enjoy more the outdoors too. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by board, smooth sidewwalks;..."" (Source 3).

The third advantage is it would be less traffic. Traffic is very annoying especially when your trying to get somewhere quickly. By limiting your car usage there's less traffic. ""...rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;..."" (Source 3). "" Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busues to wok during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3). Limitimg your car usage it would let people get to where their going faster than waiting in traffic.

In conculsion limiting your car usage will make Mother Nature happy, time to enjoy life, and reduce traffic jams. We're so comsumed by electronics we don't enjoy the life outside. BY limiting your usage it will make you enjoy the enviroment more than we enjoy it now.            ",3

You would travel on a ship with animals and other cowboys to help people who's life seems to be in ruins.

It might just change your life, like it changed mine.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you won't regret it. It was a whole lot of fun. I got to meet other cowboys and you never get bored. When I was on board ships, especially on the way back, we played games and had some pretty fun competitions. We used to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty space that used to house animals. We fenced, boxed, and held table-tennis tournaments. It was a lot of fun!

You get to help people; this is a big reason to join. You get to become part of an organization that helps people who need it, desperately. You could become their hero. Becoming part of something like this changes your whole life. It made me selfless and aware of the world around me. That awareness has been with me through my whole life. Although I'm no longer a Seagoing Cowboy, I'm still aware of what's happening to people around the world and how lucky I am. I let international students and exchange visitors into my house as an effort to help.

You get an amazing expereince along the way. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see Europe and China, tour a castle in Crete, see the Acropolis in Greece, and even get a view at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have been able to have any of these experiences if it weren't for being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Now that you know all about the Seagoing Cowboys program and the benefits of being part of it, go sign up! You could be a person's hero. Mend the hearts of those who feel like they have nothing left. Feed those who hunger with no way to recieve food. Take the oppurtunity of a lifetime, and, maybe, it will change your whole life, like it changed mine.              ",4
09330dc,"Many people may argue about the advantages of limited car usage. ""When i had a car, i was always tense, im much happier this way"" (Source 1). Many countries including France, Colombia, and Germany seem to have no problem with limited car usuage.

Germany is one of the greatest countries that is against low car life. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. 57 percent sold a car to move Germany. (Source 1). In total their is approximatly 5,500 residents and has a low car life because their are less space for parking.

One of the most populated city in France is Paris. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear up the polution. A 22-euro fine was given if one failed to corespond with the rules. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine . After 5 days of almost car free roads (not including bus and taxis) the traffic went down by 60 percent.(Source 2). The biggest problem of the smog was Diesel fuel. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that has 53.3 percent average on Diesel.

For 3 straight years, Bogota has been doing ""Day Without Cars"" that limites transportation only allowing buses and taxis. the goal for this day is to reduce smog in the capital city. Violators who failed to corespond was faced with a $25 fines. "" Millons of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took the buses to work during this car-free day"" (Source 3). The whole family went to parks and sports centers to occupy their day. Even two others Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined in on this event.

What both countries are trying to do is limited cars so less polution. Their are other transportation besides cars that we can use.                                                 ",2
09344c3,"The world of driveless cars will come in the near future says Sergey Brin. Since the 1950s, the car companies have been thinking of self-driving cars. Some people may agree to these smarter cars but others may stick to just driving themselves everywhere. If I had to choose I would much rather be driven by the diverless cars, but I don't think I'd trust them to not get in any accidents.

I have mixed feeling about these cars because I'd prefer one but have to choose the other choice. So my final choice would be that I'd drive myself. I would drive myself because I would feel safe knowing I had the wheel and not some AI that could malufunction or make a wrong choice. In other words I would know what's going on and know what to do in bad situtations, such as the article said in other car accidents, difficult traffic situtation, and bad divers. Also, the GPS that the car has could be out dated and not go the right way, so you would probably be late to where ever you are going. Which brins me to my next point, my mom always makes me late so if I leave a little late then I need to drive a little faster than the speed limit (but not enough to be pulled over) to make it on time. Another thing I wanted to bring up is if the car is diverless and all you need to do is tell the car where to go, then is would be easy for little kids to get in the car and make the car drive not knowing what they are doing and get in accidents easier.

I could agree with some things on the driveless cars. The first thing I can agree on is that it has sensors so that it can sense other cars coming towards it. I also like how they might be different versions to the self-driving cars, like som might be sensored or some might beamagnetized. Finally, I like how if you were to get in a tight spot, then the car will force you to do all the heavy lifting so you don't get hurt.

The driverless cars have their ups and downs but they will probably end up in our laps sooner than we know it. The driverless cars are in our future and that future is not far away. But I, like some people, will stick to the old way of drive a car. ",3
093da21,"The machine by Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe is very helpful in the classroom in many ways, as the article helps explain. It can help to determine what lesson plans are working for the students and what lesson plans are not working as well. Also, it can help how another student is feeling about something non-school related.

The machine, as said in the text, uses the 44 major muscles to understand how a student or any other person is feeling. An example is when it says in paragraph 6 that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is significant because this can tell if a student fully understand what the teacher is teaching and if he or she is learning. Also, it can tell what kind of lessons or lesson plans the students will react to the most.

Another way the machine is significant is because if a student is getting bullied or getting made fun of. The machine will know and that can further help and get the help the student needs without saying anything. This could prevent stuff going too far and prevent further cases of this type of thing happening.

In conclusion, there is many ways the machine by Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe can be a significance for students and teachers in the classroom. Two of those examples are to understand how to make a lesson plan work for the students and also to help students that aren't showing that they need help in school or out of school.",3
0946813,"Driverless Cars

Creating driverless cars in the world seems like a big deal today. In all reality, having driverless cars around the world can be an accident just waiting to happen. If you really think about it, teenagers would most likely be the main ones buying driverless cars. Drinking while driving, texting, and falling asleep may accur when entering a driverless car. Is creating a car that drives on it's own really worth costing a life?

Drinking when driving is a huge mistake people tend to make. Giving them a car that works on its own, and allows you to sit there and get more drunk is not a very bright idea. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If you are drunk and the car alerts you to take control you may not even respond.

Texting and driving happens with anyone and everyone. People are way too focused on seeing what their friend sent them instead of paying attetion to the road. Alot of collisions have happend because of one driver texting and driving. "" Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters they need a whole lot of sensors."" Say those sensors just happend to suddenly cut off and not give any warning. How will a person know when to look up from their addictive phone?

Working hard days 24/7 can make a person extreamly sleepy. Say you get off of work and your exhausted, and a peaceful song comes on the radio. While listening to that song you fall into a deep sleep while your car takes you back to your house. ""Their cars have driven more than half a mile without a crash."" Maybe the test cars didn't have a problem with the driverless cars but what if somthing breaks in your car and it loses control? The sleepy driver is in deep sleep and could die from the driverless car manufacturing.

In conclusion, having a driverless car does not make the world any safer nor better. It gives people a better chance to drink and drive, text and drive, even sleep and drive. How is making driverless cars anysafer yet better to the world?

In all reality, it makes it more dangerous. ",4
0947cdc,"There are several advantages when you limit car usage. One, you will reduce greenhouse gases. Two, you will lower the stress level of people when they thinking about driving. Three, young people will decrease their amount of driving. Overall, limiting car usage can help fellow citizens.

Limiting car usage wil reduce greenhouse gases. In Source 1 the passage states that passaenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. While we limit car usage you will not only help reduce greenhouse gases,but you will help reduce air pollution. When theres no air pollution there will be a clean atmosphere. Furthermore, limiting car usage can benefit the enviorment.

Limiting car usage will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Everyday people have to plan before they drive. Sometimes when people plan for driving they get stressed thinking about if theirs traffic or what if the road is closed. In Source 3 the passage states that rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Furthermore, limiting car usage will limit the stress level of people thinking about driving.

Limiting car usage will decrease young people's amount of driving. In Source 4 the passage states that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license. Another study in Source 4 was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If their's less young people driving then there will be less accidents occuring. Overall, limiting car usage will keep young drivers from injurying themselves.

Either way limiting car usage will help our fellow citizens in general. This will reduce greenhouse gases. This will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Also, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of young people driving. Futhermore limiting car usage will help us citizens.    ",4

There isn't just one reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program there are thousands of reasons. The main things are the locations,the people, and the experiences.

To start my reasoning, you could help thousands of people. You could also have fun on your adventures sailing to all these different contries and states. As you grow you will learn more about what you are doing. You could get really cool things when your traveling too. You could even help take care of animals.

Secondly, you could do really cool things on board. You could get to watch animals, play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis touraments, fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games that could pass the time. All of those things Luke did on board. You can do all of those things in empty holds.

In addition, for Luke it was much more than an adventure. You have someone to look off of and to see a ture experienceof being a Seagoing Cowboy. Now you should see why Luke said it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In concusion,I see why its so great to be a Seagoing Cowboys. The places you travel to,the people who you travel with, and the adventures. Just think of all the fun you could have on that very special boat just wondering what lies on the other side of that island and what you could learn the points are endles. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and then you could get in for sure. How you will react when you take that first step onto the next part of your life

Some of the parts to make this possible are ,''Luke could't say no. He knew it was an opportiunity of a lifetime. Paragraph 7 tells you that he lives with his aunt Katie and paragraph 8 is where i got how many things he did while he was on board and why they thought theose activities were fun.

By using the voting system of majority win can force or pursuade people to start voting because most people know that there votes wont even matter when electoral voting system is taking place with popular votes even the slitest of just one vote changes who becomes president so i would think people will start being apart of there states votes an become better citezens by voting.3

Here are some of the disaddvantages when having an electoral voting system

Are votes don't even matter when voting for presiden who knows if voting for electors and that electer dose not do as we want for electing the right president having this type of voting system is so much complicated for the process you half to go through when electing a president.        ",2
0952aee,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process but is time we move on from it. Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes. ""It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"" (source 3) This may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college.

This process is also unfair to voters because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (source 2).

There has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes including ..."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO"" (Source 2). These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past.

Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes. In my eyes it appears the electoral college has slightly to much impact on the outcome of the election. Imagine running for president and you when the hearts of the voters with popular votes but happen to lost the election because you didn't have enough electoral votes. How would you feel about the electoral college after that experience? This is why there is a need for change in the electoral college. Save candidates from losing an election that they should have one but didn't becuase they didn't have enough electoral votes.                                          ",4
0958685,"I , Luke Bomberger, am a memeber of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Saegoing Cowboys help people who were affected by the war.

I believe everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for three reasons.

Not only do you get that warm fuzzy feeling from helping people out, but you also have a once in a lifetime chance to go sightseeing have the time of your life onboard, and explore the most beutiful and amazing places on Earth.

By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you get to help out the less fortunate explore go sightseeing and have fun.

We help people by bringing them animals from overseas such as horses, cows ,and mules.

When we bring the people the animals it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling of acomplishment.

You should also join because after our missions, we have some time left to go sightseeing in the area.

Some of my favorite things to see were the Panama Canal and ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

I also had the opportunity to expore much of Europe and China as well as taking a gondola ride in Italy. I also got to take a tour of a castle in Crete. If you think that the fun stops when you climb back aboard for the ride home, think again.

The stables where the animals were kept becomes a baseball field and a volley ball court.

We also have table tenis tournaments as well as boxing and fencing matches.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun as well as important.

In conclusion, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

I reccomend becoming a Seagoing Cowboy because not only are you helping the world, but you get to have fun while you do it such as sightseeing and exploring.

I myself have gone on nine trips as a Seagoing Cowboy and loved every second of it.

It also opened up my eyes and ""made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""

This technology will benefit our society in different ways, like in education. The technology to read students emotions is valuable to our schools.

The first way in which this technology is vaulable to schools is by improving lessons. Often times, many students of different calibers are thrust into the same classroom. While some grow bored others become confused by the content of the lesson. In the article, Dr. Huang is quoted saying, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. If we implemented this emotion recognition technology, we could help students of all levels grow and reach their potential.

Another reason why technology that can recognize emotions is vaulable in schools is because of fighting and bullying. In paragraphs three and four of the article, it discusses how the technology works and what it can do. It claims that it can dectect mixed emotions and even, in paragraph 8, detect fake smiling. This technology could be used to detect when students are angry and wanting to fight or even sad from being bullied. Teachers cannot always detect these things from students, especially if they are trying to hide them.

In addition to stopping fights and helping bullied students, this emotion recognition technology could assist in identifying students who have problematic home lives and need help. Although this would not always be 100% accurate, it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. This would aid in making schools a happier place. It could also negate problems that they could have later in life. Installing this technology in our schools would be highly beneficial.

Schools need the technology to read students emotions. It would fit in with other technological advancements that have improved our education system. Advances in technology helped to improve not just our education, but our overall lives. Numerous people in our world cannot live without technology. Technology is important to our society.

You should be the one in control of the car not the other way around, there could be a malfunction with the car that might cause a wreak, and they don't need more technology to a car, because at the end of the day your not going to have it all of your life. I'm against having the google car, because who needs a literally has laser beams that comes out of the top of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

You should be the one in control of the car at all times. A person learns how to drive for a reason. They learn how to drive, so that their parents don't have to anymore, to maybe go places by yourself, and just to swee how well you have learned to drive and how much you have improved before you started to drive in the first place. Having a human drive you is better than a robot driving you because you have an advantage of learning and continuing how to learn how.

Having malfunctions is a big problem. there is alot that can happen to you if you manage to mess something up or if you just crash and wreak your car. You can push a button that can do some serious harm to you or anyone that is in the car at the time, you can break some bones by cracking into another car or a tree, and it can make you have some type of brain damage.

In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China. You had to do a little work to because its says in paragraph seven during the crossings it kept Luke busy and he had to check the animals every hour. I also believe it is alot of traveling because in the introduction it says that Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 16 times. In paragraph nine it also talks about how he felt much more than just an adventure for Luke. In paragraph four its says that they knew he was a cattle-boat trip but they told him just to keep doing it for his service.

There is also many other different things to do if you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy and I think Luke really enjoyed it because in paragraph seven it says that Luke was happy to be alive.

096b178,"Cars are used used in everyday life but they may be used too much because of all the damage they do to the environment and the citizens must be informed on it. Cars are used to help get around easier unless if towns are developed so that people can walk or ride a bike everywhere. Cars cause pollution which causes smog and it can really hurt peoples health and the environment. A life without cars can make plenty of people happy due to the fact that people get injured or die in cars every day.

To start off most towns do not build buildings close together because people have cars which takes up more time to get there and money for gas. If buildings were made closer together everyone could get to the stores quickly and back home in time for special events. If buildings were made closer gasoline would be less of a problem due to the prices being high. In a town called Vauban in Germany seventy percent of all families do not own an automobile.""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car,and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg.

Cars are known to cause pollution and some places have a partial ban on cars. Paris is well known for the Eiffel Tower and also its pollution problem so Paris allowed people with even and odd number license plates to only drive on certain days or else they will be fined. When cars cause pollution it makes smog and smog can kill crops and animals if it gets out of control. Currently heavily populated areas such as Newyork has a big pollution problem causing grey skies.

A life without cars is a happy one according to some people. A place in Colombia calles Bogota made an event called ""Car-free day"" which is a day where everyone goes the entire day without driving ""It's a good opportunity to take away streaa abd lower air pollution"".""These people are generating a revolutionary change and it is crossing boarders"".""The rain hasn't stopped anyone from participating"".

The reasons people should cut down on car usage is to lower pollution in the air. It just makes people happier without vehicles. Towns could be made with closer buildings to prevent using too much gas. Smog can really make an environment unhealthy by killing some of the plants that are there.    ",4
096eae9,"I think that driverless cars should be used, because they have many thing such as sensors, smart road systems, driver mimicry and more .

In the passage it talks about how the car has all those sensors, because it can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel . That means if the driver is someone who has driven for years that menas that the car can mimic that and have the same driving skills as the person driving .

I am for driverless cars because it doesnt say anything in the passage about how a car has crashed. in fact, the passage states; ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" with that being said, these cars could be really safe for drivers. Also, that could mean that the car drives better than a human can .

Another reason I am for driverless cars is because, they wouldnt use much fuel, it states in the passage that; "" The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Regular buses and taxis would most likely go out of business, and driverless cars would take over. That fuel could also help get people to farther destinations. For example, if someone who lives in New York wanted to go to Florida, it could be done, no plane required.

0973664,"The Electoral college should be abolished. This form of voting is unfair to the candidates. The people that vote for the candidates they only vote for a chance that their candidate may have enough people that voted for him or her in that state to recieve a slate of pre-selected electors. there is also a very likely chance that the voting may end in a tie and the election will preceed to the House of Representatives where the state delegations would vote for a president.

The electoral college is a verey unfair way of voting to the candidates because if the majority of U.S. citizens vote for an opposing candidate that candidate would have the chance to lose the election if the states favor the current president or other candidates.

When a state has election day the people who vote, vote not for the president but a slate of electors. When the state counts the votes, it then decides which party gets the slate of electors based on the majority of the votes and the elctors cast votes for their candidates.

Posner it states that ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". If ther ewas no electoral college the election would only rely on popular votes and in turn make the process of choosing a president easier and more simple. This process would also recieve distaste as does the electoral college.

As said by many the Electoral College should be abolished. The process is very complex and unfair. Why only dpend on a majority of state chosen elector when the citezens could be the electors. The only way to get a fair vote is without the electoral college.    ",3
0975e3f,"Driverless cars might not be just a myth or a fantasy anymore. Google has had cars that can drive independantly since 2009. Though they have gone more than half a million miles without a crash, there are cons to these typs of cars. They arn't entirely driverless yet. These cars still need help getting through places like work zones and accidents. These cars are expensive and still need human help, but they do come with a special safety feature that normal cars don't have.

Driverless cars can be helpful, but they are still expensive. The roads would more than likely have to be updated. General Motors and engineers from Berkeley have both tried different ways to improve the roads. This included roads embedded with electrical cables or magnets, sending signals to the car. These methods proved to be unreasonably expensive. Engineers then looked at making smarter cars. To make them smart enough to drive safely without the help of people and smart roads they would need many sensors. They would need at least nine different sensors. Putting that many sensors on enough cars for everyone to drive would be very costly.

People could also benefit from these cars if they truly were driverless. These so called ""driverless"" cars can't do many things a person can do while driving. For instance, these cars can't pull in or out of driveways. They also can't make it through roadwork or accidents. Currently, the fastest that driverless cars can handle is 25 miles per hour. This would definitly not be safe on a highway or interstate. These cars are ment to take people where they need to go, but the driver must remain focus if they need to take the wheel.

There are pros to cars like these though. There has to be something to keep the ""driver"" interested while waiting for their turn to drive, so some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. If there is something that keeps the driver entertained, there has to be something to get them alert again. These entertainment features can be turned off when needed, pulling the drivers attention back to the road. These safety percautions arn't currently in cars for texting and driving.

Though these cars do come with a safety feature, they are still expensive and can't fully drive alone. I do believe the world can benefit from these cars, but i see to many red flags for them to be reasonable at this time. ",4
09763fb,"Would you keep your vehicle at home for a day and walk to work? Well in Bogota there is a car-free day, people all over the town partcipate in this event. According to the article, ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yestraday."" On this day only buses and taxis are permitted to rome the streets for the day. The reason behind having a car-free day is because cars cause smog, which can cause congestion in the city.

In Paris, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" Diesel is favored over gasoine because of a tax policy, because of diesel France was polluted with smog. Since France took away the use of cars for evn numbered license plate owners for the day delivery companies complained of ""lost revenue,"" but if you had a ""plug-in car, hybrid, or cars carrying three or more passengers"" had exceptions. On the next day, odd numbered lisence plate owners were followed to keep their car at home but instead the smog had cleared enough on that Monday for the ruling French to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates.

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" article they talked about the people walking or bicycling to work or places they wanted to go. Many people might have decided to not take a car to go places because there was limited parking, which only consists of two parking garages. Now, 70 percent of families don't own cars in Vauban, which is shocking because they all either walk or take a bicycle ride.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. The United States of America is now responding to these other countries and their way to reduce car usage. Obama ambitious gaols to curb the United States greenhouse gas problem might be paying off. The article ""The End of Car Culture states ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" If Americans are buying less vehicles than that's a way to a good start for lowering greenhouse gases.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have many advantages. Since caar usage causes greenhouse gases and smog, limiting by a little or alot will always help to reduce the amounts  of these gases in the air that we humans breath. People in differnt countries like France, Germany, and Bogota are coming up with many unique ways to help reduce the car usage. Limiting the car usage helps with the gas expensives, and helps with finding other ways for transportation.         ",3
097b864,"Dear State Senitor,

Abolishing The Electoral College

We are the United States of America. We have learned that we have the freedom of free speech, practices, and choices. This is what we have learned that we supposively do. If we can't pick out who will rule over us, then what are we doing with ourselfs?

We deserve to have a choice in choosing who will rule our country. The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers in the Constitution. Constitutions like these eventually get revised. This method is too outdated.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have all agreeded that to abolish the electoral college. Popular votes was something they all had in mind when choosing the president. It was shown the 60% of voters would prefer a direct election, than having the electoral college. That's more than half!

The best argument against it, is the the disaster factor. From this, the system keeps allowing worse and worse things every year. In the Electoral College, size and population of the states matter a lot. It can be unfair for a smaller state with a smaller population against a bigger state with a wider population. It is a winner-takes-all situation. Candidates don't spand that much time in states that they know they aren't going to win in. The electoral college is unfair and very outdated. We must adapt to the new demand of freedom of choice.

In short, it is better for a voter to know that their vote was counted towards something big. Maybe it was their vote that changed it all. We, as the United States of America, we have learned that our freedom is earned, not given. By this, it may take a while to convince those around that the Electoral College should be taken down or revised. We should get what we voted for because our voice counts .    ",3
0980c17,"Dear Senator,

While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote.

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.    ",2
098c450,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a wonderful program. I really liked this article it gave me a lot of information about this program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a helpful program. I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will give you some reasons to support my opion.

One reason is they are very caring, because World War II ended, and it is 1945 and many countries were messed up from the war. so 44 nations joined together to help it's called the UNRRA, the UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys. So they both were helping these countries. So that is a reason why you should join because they are caring. Another reason is they go across the world to help countries. So when you think about you can go on tours to some places across the world and go sight seeing, so that is pretty cool. Last reason is just doing the right thing it is a very caring and helpful program to help innocent people who were not in the war, that died and houses got damage. so it is a helpful thing to do and fun thing to join.

some details that support luke claims is in paragraph 5 it says that one of the boys in the smalltown said besides helping people he had time to see Europe and China so like luke said it's not only just helping people you have time to go on tours of places in some of these different countries that you never ever seen that place before and go on a tour of that place in that country. Another detail is in paragraph 8 it says that it is fun on board coming back because they played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments,and a few other games so joining will be fun because when you are on board or on the ship you can play games.

So that is all I have. I think people should really recommend participating in

Seagoing Cowboys program beacuse I think it is a wonderful program. I agree with Luke point of view you should convince others to participate in this program. It helps others and yourself. I would participate in this program if I could.",2
098d10a,"The planet Venus may be one of our most valuable assets to understand our planet, but Venus has some dangers we cannot ignore. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job of suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by explaining the value of exploring Venus, the dangers, and how the dangers may be overcome.

Venus is very similar to Earth, sharing approximate densities and sizes. The planet also shares geographical features with Earth, such as rocky sediment, craters, and mountains. It is possible that hundreds of years ago Venus really might have been the twin planet to Earth. Astronomers have reason to beleive that Venus was home to oceans and various life forms. If we learn more about this planet, we could find the key to unlock the knowledge of how our home planet works. This supports the author's claim that we must study Venus further by providing reasons knowledge of Venus would directly affect everyday life on Earth.

The author also uses the possible dangers of exploring Venus to explain why we must pursue Venus, through all the challenges. Venus has a heavy atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide, making it impossible for humans to breathe freely on the planet. The pressure on Venus is so great that a person would be crushed, not to mention the extreme temperatures over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit. It would be impossible for an astronaut to explore on the planet's surface without proper technology. Adding to the already intense conditions, Venus has volcanoes, eartquakes, and frequent lightning, which present their own problems. The dangers help prove the author's point that even though dangerous, we must explore Venus.

The author describes possible solutions created by NASA to show that it will be possible to explore Venus, even with the dangers. NASA has proposed an idea of humans studying Venus from a vehicle hovering the planet, but this would not be optimal because the exploration would be very limited. Viewing Venus from thirty feet above would be better than no exploration at all and would create livable conditions, so it is a relatively safe option for gathering knowledge on the planet. Another idea is using mechanical computers on Venus. The computers can make calculations, without electronics. These computers are also more likely to withstand the extreme conditions of Venus, unlike modern computers. No plan can be one hundred percent safe, especially in a danger zone like Venus, but the benefits outweigh the risks. The author does a proficient job of portraying this in the article.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author presents the idea that Venus should be studyed intently, despite the risks. The author does a good job of explaining this by telling how we could benefit from knowledge of Venus, telling the dangers, and solutions to overcome the dangers of Venus. ",5

The auther said that we could benfit by overcoming the high tempertures and amaking a stronger matrial that can with stand the sulfuric acid atmosphere. Another way we could benfit form is by making stong submarine so we would be able to dive deeper into the deepest parts of the oceans on earth.

The auther said that NASA idea of flying over venus is one way we could overcome the hard surface conditions that venus. That we would never run out of energy because venus is the second close planet to the sun. The temp is at around 170 degrees fahrenheit and that radiation levels are low so it is survivable for humans.

0999761,"Driverless cars are about to be the future. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, has a dreams of a future with public transportation system where driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. In my opinion, driverless cars are going to be brilliant. I believe just like Sergey that driverless cars can change the world. And google is making sure it is all safe.

The cars that Sergey imagines would use half the fuel of today's taxis. That is absolutly great way to save money on gas. The driverless cars would offer way more flexibility than any bus.

Google has already had cars that could drive independently since 2009. Those cars have passed many tests for saftey. The cars have also driven more than half a million miles without crashing. Google's cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in or out of a driveway, and dealing with complicated traffic. For example passing an accident or going through roadwork.

To improve these smart cars they needed a whole lot of senors. The car google modified was a Toyota Prius. Google put postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The most important piece google put on the car was the spinning sensor on the roof. The spinning sensor on the roof uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surrondings. All these senors google is using is necessary for the driverless car to mimic a human and the wheel.

Sensors were invented in the 1980's. Sensors have improved so much they can detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. Sensors can get information too cause the car to apply braked on individual wheels. Sensors can also reduce the power from the engine, which is far more that was a human can do from the wheel. Even with all the things sensors can do they still will keep improving.

In 2013, BMW developed the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car will be able to handle speeds up tp 25 mile per hour, but the senors from ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" will make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. The car can steer, brake, and accelerate themselves. But are designed to notify the drive when the road ahead requires human skills. For example going through a work zone or arounf accidents. The human must stay alert and be ready to take over when needed. GM has also developed the driver seat to viberate when they are in danger. Other options they have is flashing lights on the windsheild. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch the drivers remaining focused on the road.

Google is making sure all the driverless cars will be on the safe side. I believe driverless cars will change the world. In my opinion driverless cars need to be created for the future. If all the tests goes right there should be no problem. Sergey Brin has a dream for public transportation to be better. Driverless cars are about to be the future. ",4

09a04e4,"We are very close to Venus and Mars, and at some points we are closer to Venus than Mars and vise versa. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea that they want to send humans to Venus to study this planet, but there is a lot of dangers involved if they do that. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving all the reason why humans should go, bad things that could happen if humans landed on Venus, and things they can do to make this idea work.

NASA already beleives that there could be life on Mars and that people could be living on Mars in a couple decades or even less, so why wouldn't they want to find that out about another planet. It has already been suggested that there once was life on Venus. In paragrpah 4 it states ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"". NASA thinks that being on the land we would be able to study it better because they don't think peering at Venus from a ship orbiting is doing enough. It is also giving them challenges that they can work on the equipment to make it last longer.

In article ""the Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it does state the bad outcomes if we landed on Venus and what could go wrong. In paragraph 3 it talks about the conditions on Venus for example, ""On the planet's surface, temperaturess average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". It also states that the condition on Venus are more extreme than anything humans have encountered on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in or solar system. These things are very dangerous, but despite the dangers this article is still able to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit.

In paragraph 5 they focus on things they would have to do to avoid the dangerous conditions, for example one thing is allowing scientist to float above the fray. Floating over the fray of Venus would be just like our jet airplanes. The conditions in Venus are not easy, but they would be survivable for humas. The only way to study Venus well is by being on the planet because looking at venus far away can only provide limited insight on ground conditions. Scientist want to be able to take samples from the ground and from the rocks on Venus.

The dangers of going to Venus should not stop us. It is worth it to face some of the dangers to make history and discover new things especially on another planet. The dangers of Venus will only push scientist harder to find a way to make it to venus. It will also push them to design new technology that could stand being in Venus's conditions. There is many evidence to prove that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",4
09a62eb,"Driverless cars are an advance in technology, even though they are not fully self automatic yet .Driverless cars may not be fully driverless yet but in the future it is possible. Even if people dont like the idea of it its still going to happen. Driverless cars are not going to be any good for our generation.

Driving is something that you will need your full attention for even if the car is self driven it can still screw up. I don't personally see the point of somthing that is not going to help anyone. Chances are that there will be more accidents and more people will be injured or even die because all technology malfunctions at one point or another and there is no stopping that. Technology is a good thing when it is helping people. Times are changing and no one can stop it. In paragraph 9 it says who will be responsible if the car happens to mess up the manufacturer or the driver.

Think to yourself who would you hold responsible. Knowing that all technology malfunctions,not to mention the car would be overly priced just for it to be able to drive without a driver and sense things. Most people like being aware if their surroungings. What if the car stoped and the driverless addition stoped working .You would already be used to not driving and over all forget how to do it. You wouldn't be aware of where you are because you were to busy doing other things then to know your surroundings.

Knowing how to drive makes things easier on you. Technology is not always a good thing. Technology doesn't always work out the way you want it too its easy to look something up and the internet not give you what you want or what's true would you trust your care taking you to where ever? It's easy saying something is better because it has technology incorperated but is that really true.

Some things are better left with out all the added gadgets and I belive a car is one of those things. A car is more reliable when you personaly are controling it. You know where you are going and I think if they want to make additions to are car make tires that don't go flat or make the car fix its self. Knowing how to get places yourself will make things so much easier on you. If your tire goes flat your car can not take you to the nearest area to call someone or get help.

09a7f87,"The use of technology being able to read emotional expressions of students is not valuble. It invades student's privacy. It's a likely chance that a student emotions will not change because of what the computer detects, and also some people may not like the idea of being so closely connected with a computer/ technology.

There are many times where you have probably witnessed a friend or person's face looking too calm or sad to you, and when you asked them what's wrong they tell you nothing. Eventhough when they tell you this you know something might be wrong. After a while you start to just let it go,respect their privacy and wait til they're ready to really tell you whats's on their mind. This applies the same way from a computer to a student. Some students may not want the computer to be invading their privacy and knowing what's wrong with them, they would rather keep it to themselves.

09af24e,"My argument against ""Driverless Cars"" is that im going for it. The reason why is because we have advanced in our technology so it would only be wise to try and use that. Also because I think personally it could save many lives with its self brake instalation, self parking, and many other features. As I was reaing the artical it mentioned that the driver would have to still be alert because if theirs an accadent or workers ahead then the driver must be the one to avoid that. That dosent mean it a bad idea, it just means that maybe our technology isnt that advanced and cant avid things such as work sites ahead or accidnts. I think the reason they cant detect accidents is because you never know when ones going to happen, same with workers ahead your car may not be able to detect it because it could happen in a sudden flash. My position on driverless cars is that i think it will be a great idea. I like i said save many lives, know im not saying it will save everyones life but out o thousands it could decrease by hundred.

Appropriate details from the artical that supporst my position is when it talks about how it has automic brakes and self parking and many other features. Its great to have that type of things because as i ahve been saying it could save many lifes, and that important because no one wants to see their family dead. Self break is good because it could be late nd you have been working all day long and your tired and you fall asleep in the car right when a car is pulling out or your car turns a different direction and your close to hitting somethong and it just automatically stops. Or like most parents, you have a young child in the back and hes/shes crying andyou turn around for just a split secound and your car just comes to a complete stop.

Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article ""Pairs bans driving due to smog"" that congestion was down 60 percent in the captial of france after 5 day of intensifiying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car acciedent.

In the passage ""car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" that they for one whole day dont use cars. They instead ride bikes every where because they want to reduce smog as Pairs wants to. In the passage it says that since its such a big hit that two more colombian cites, Cail and Valledupar joined the event. They have built over 118 miles of bike paths, the most of any latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. It also says that ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.

The final reason why you limit car use is thier would be less of a chance for you to get hurt or even worse. Thier are many acciedent evey year because of drunk and reckless drivers many have lost thier lives to idiots on the road. Thier was a story on the news that three teenage kids died in a car acciedent because they where under the influnce of drugs. They could have hurt other people the reporter said they crashed into a store and the store owner almost got hurt. Those kids almost took someone else life which is scary but if you limit your car use thier wont be that many acciedents.

All in all if you just limit your use of the car you can be helping out a bunch. The pollution can be reduced not as many car acciedents you can save your self some money. Also you can get more excersie in if you dont use your car that often.                       ",4

And why would you use that in a class room any way to spy on people thats a little creepy you know and also why would the teacher even what that becouse thats looking at them too. So there for in my choice the technology is not valuale and should not be put into classrooms or anywhere for that matter becouse every needs that privcy and no one will be able to get that if that technology is around.

09bd6f6,"Driverless cars are not a good idea for the future. They will create safety problems, cause more people to become obese, and cause more problems between the manufactuer and the customer.

Driverless cars will create a lot of safety problems. Drivers will think it is okay to sit back and relax on a road trip. If they were to fall asleep and there were to be a bad accident, the driver could have a possibility of sooner death. The driver would be more alert without a special car to drive for him. In the article it said that some manufactuers of the driverless car wanted to put entertainment in the cars. The driver will be too distracted. Putting entertainment in front of the driver is basically the same thing as putting a phone in front of them, which is illegal, and killed many people in car accidents. Needless to say, there can be many safety problems.

Driverless cars will cause many to become obese. Some people are already too lazy to walk a block down the street so they choose to drive. If driverless cars were to start selling, can you imagine how much more lazy people would get? They wouldn't have to do such a simple task such as turnihng the wheel, or turning there turning signals on. People will start bringing more and more food in the car if there happens to be entertainment. People need to excercise even if it is just a walk down the block. Obesity is not what people want.

Imagine getting in an accident in a driverless car. Many people will not take the blame because in all honesty, it wasn't their fault. They weren't the ones driving the car, so how it could it have been their fault? Customers will want their money back from buying the ""amazing"" driverless car they bought. Manufactuers will only be making more trouble for themselves. This will only result in more conflict. This will create worldwide problems.

As a result these futuristic cars are just not a good idea. It will only end in conflict. I think that people should stick to the regular cars they have. There is nothing wrong with cars we have in todays society.    ",4
09c0506,"Dear Rick Scott,

Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state (Florida, Texas, etc.) to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College canidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are apposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican canidate. Many people say that the electoral college ""takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn't matter"" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the memebers of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?

Not only do the Citizen's votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state's vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids run-off elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state's vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a run-off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats; that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reudces, ultimatley showing a clear winner.

And finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State's Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It's also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimatley the most dangerous voter there is; an uner educated one.

So Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen's vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state's smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.             ",5
09c4d28,"I would tell the person that the ,famous face, on Mars, is a natural land form and not created by aliens.

In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of Cydonia, where the face was located, and the pictures show that the face was actually a butte ,or a mesa.

The face actually became popular in the mid 70's and had many conspiracies behind it. When the first picture released to the public, it quickly gained traction with fans. The picture was taking by Viking 1, when it was snapping photos for it sister ship Viking 2. After releasing the picture to the public, it became extradonarily popular, the face was starring in movies, books,magazines, and even radio talk shows. Then rumors started to spread that NASA

was hiding the fact that there was life on Mars.

In September 1997,NASA's number one priority was to photographing Cydonia, where the face is located, when the Mars Global Surveyor arrived at Mars. So on April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia. When the pictured appeared online at a JPL website, thousands of people were dissapointed that it was a natural landform and not some type of a alien monument. But there was still some belivers out there and said that Cydonia is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude,on April 98', which is a cloudy time of the year

for Mars. They also said that perhaps the alien markings were hidden by a haze.

Three years has went by and the Mars Global Surveyor finally drew close to Cydonia. It was a cloudless summer day,so therefore it couldn't be an excuse for a haze or clouds to be blocking the alien markings. After NASA had set up the Mars Global Surveyor in a spot to get the face in a pefect position, they caught a photo usuing the camera's absolute resolution. The picture caught Mars equivalent of a butte or a mesa.

In conclusion, the face was a natural landform,that resembled that of a human face. Also, the face was a big pop icon and gave people the idea that there was some type of lifeform in ,the Red Planet, Mars.   ",3

09cc092,"Dear Florida state senator,

The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is non-democratic way in most people's eyes.

Although, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.

I said it was a non-democratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of Independance was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.

Speaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outragously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and Claifornia has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.

In the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a non-democratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states.

Yours sincerily, Alexandria    ",4

I think the electoral college should be changed and people old enough to vote should be able to chhose who they want to be president. I think people should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because. And he start destroying the economy and he starts taking away things that some people need to survive or maintain.

One reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because what if someone gets elected as president and for example he or she decides to begin a marshal law in the whole united states. Then he starts putting a chip in evevyones body and we get told when to eat and when not to eat. Then he or she starts to put us in concentration camps and we get paid 2 cents a hour and killed if we dont cooperate.

Another reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be president is because. Its not fair to people cause that would be like a citizens vote doesnt even count and the government doesnt really care about what citizens think and they dont care about how we feel. Then if the wrong person gets elected and he or does something no one likes everybody gone be mad cause they didnt for that to happen.

Finally I think citizens should be able to vote for who they want to be president is because I honestly dont think the government doent care how anybody feel. And The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college method for selecting presidents may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no carrying their state.

Now you see why I think people should be able to choose who they want to be president. I hope you enjoy reading my letter and i hope you see where im coming from and what im talking about.     ",2

09da56a,"Over the years the amount of cars that have been manufactured have increased immensly. Cars help us get to place quicker by making less effort to get there. We no longer need to walk to go to the park or the mall which can take a long time. Although cars are very useful and fun to drive, it also has its risk like anything else on Earth. Which is why i think limiting car usage would be a great idea.

Most cars use gasoline or diesel as there fuel to get them going. This causes problems because the fuel that is burned pollutes the atmosphere and creates smog. Paris had this problem before. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer says that Paris had ""days of near-record pollution"" and they attempted to reduce it by applying a 22-euro fine ($31). As a result congestion in Paris was down 60 percent and the smog, as stated in the article, ""cleared enough for the French party to rescind the ban of odd-numbered plates"" Getting rid of the smog and having less air pollution would help not only the environment but i can also help us breathe oxygen easier. Limiting car usage can help us decrease pollution and increase breathable oxygen.

Limiting car usage can benfit us in many ways. It can reduce air pollution which not only helps us breathe better but it also helps the environment. It can also relieve stress. Everyone that drives a car knows how stressful it can be sometimes. Any traffic jam can turn a regular day to a stressful day. Hearing someone honking their horn, yelling ""Come on! Move already!"" and adding some unnecesary profanity can be very irritating. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky says that for the third straight year the city of Bogota have a car-free day called Day Without Cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" states the article. A lot of people actually participated in this event even thought it rained that day. The Mayor of Bogota Antanas Mockus said that even though it is raining it ""hasn't stopped people from participating"". It was a great idea to have a day like this to relax and not be stuck in traffic which is one reason why one businessman was happy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. It's a great event that should spread to the world. It will be very helpful to us and the environment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is very beneficial. It can relieve stress and reduce air pollution. It can also reduce car accidents which can decrease the number of deaths that occur in a car accident. If you're on a budget, limiting the the amount of time you use your car can help you save gas money. It can also help you excercise a little. Since you aren't using a car you have to use a different form of transportation like walking or riding a bike. These are just a few advantages that limiting car usage have. Limit your car usage, it can help you and the environment.    ",4

The Electoral College is the best proven method for electing the president and produces great results, so it should be kept. It does have its mistakes, and faults, but who or what in the world does not? Many people do not favor this method of election, and argue that:""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."",these people may be right, but for the many past presidents that it has successfully elected, either for the good or bad, we the people are the main power for it. The electoral college does not just elect the president by itself, it works on what the people elect.

The reason that many people do not favor the electoral college is that they feel insecure knowing that they aren't voting for the president directly, just for electors who are voting for their chosen presidential candidate. It is all a phsycological insecurity for those who haven't gotten used to the fact that they don't have a direct power over what they want for the well-being of the government and the citizens. Also the fact that their are flaws in this method of election gets people nervous about a disaster happening, mainly because a mistake has happened before. ""In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266."" Bradford Plumer is very against the electoral college because of its past misgivings, or mistakes, and does not trust what it might do in the future.

The electoral college may possess many past mistakes and close runs, but it works unlike any other system of election that has been thought of. It produces very certain outcomes and results, the college selects all of the votes,sorts them, and releases the correct amount of votes for the president voted for. It is the least stressful, clearest, and fairest procedure for electing the president while at the same time being fair to all of the average people voting for their desired president. Because of all of the benefits that it promises, and the outcome for every voter, this fantastic method of election should be continued at least until a better method for choosing the president of the United States is discovered, and confirmed to be superior to our current system now.

09e6583,"The Facial Action Coding System being applied for a student in the classroom can lead to many benefits and improvements in the classroom. This system could be applied in way that help develop the learning and how to teach the student to be more interactive in the classroom. Ways that this Coding System can be used to improve students in a classroom in that the System can determine whether or not a student is interactive in the class, if a student is cheating or lying, or whether things outside of school are affecting/bothering the student.

One way that this Facial Action Coding System can benefit the teacher and student is whether or not the student is interactive in the class. If the Facial Action Coding System were to take pictures of the student throughout the class and see what kind of emotions students are experiencing throughout the class, this could actually help the teacher. For example, if the student shows expressions of happiness throughout the class, then the teacher should continue her approach of learning, because happier student tend to be more interactive in the class. If the Facial Action Coding System were to analyze students feeling disgust or sadness throughout the class, this would be beneficial for the teacher in that this implies the teacher needs to change their approach and if the teacher were to question the student, how and what they (the teachers) can do to allow the students to be more interactive. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (Huang, paragraph 6). This shows that even online learning could be changed using this Coding System and that using this technology would be beneficial throughout different kinds of learning systems and different kinds of students. Also, as I said before, if the Coding System is able to detect students feeling bored or becoming confused in class, it may lead to the teacher changing his approach on how to teach the lesson.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System could also be helpful in that the system could help teacher find cheaters and dishonest students in the class. An example of this is that if the Facial Action Coding System were to detect fear or surprise if a teacher confronts a student on cheating, this will help the teacher on deciding if the teacher actually cheated or whether the student was actually innocent. Also if the student decides to lie and fake an happy expression, the machine would also be able to detect this. This author states the system is able to detect a fake expression when he states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus makes crow feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the smile is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; thes muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (D'Alto, paragraph 8). This quote shows that the machine to detect a faked expression and if the student is lying or faking an expression, the teacher will be able to call him out on it using the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Coding System could also detect whether things outside of school is affecting him and whether or not the student need help. For example, if the student were constantly to have a sad and fear expression throughout the school, the counselor/principal may be able to ask the student what is going on and why the student constantly is feeling this type of way. The counselor/principal may discover things that could be traumatizing to the student and proceed to get the studen help or aid.

In conclusion, having a Facial Action Coding System may be beneficial for both the student and the teacher in a classroom. With this system, teachers are able to identify whether they should change the way the way they teach the class, if a student is faking an expression when caught cheating or lying in the classroom, and if something is concerning a student outside of school. All of these reasons prove that schools should start implementing this new system into their technology such as video cameras, computers, and tablets. ",4
09e971b,"There will be many different opinions over weather or not we should use this technology in class rooms. The Facial Action Coding System has positive and negative sides. It could be enjoable. There is also a chance that it could just be a complete and utter fail. Though, are the benifits of students worth the negative aspects of this new technology?

If this new system were applied to our schools, students would be more likely to enjoy what they are participating in. The students would have been matched to their own personal work while still accomplishing what they need to be able to pass. Maybe students would not dread school as much as they do now. Instead of losing interest in their studies, students could enjoy learning. If students began learning on their own because they enjoyed it so much, maybe they would also take up their own studies. Could you imagine how advanced our future would be if people were actually passionate about learning?

On the other hand, some people would see the Facial Action Coding System as an invasion of privacy. They would think that what little personal life they had left was being stripped from them. Or maybe we could even be being watched all the time and not just when we are aware of it. People are already so paranoid about everything. So why not just throw in always being observed like government projects.

Some people would say this fancy new system is just to expensive. Maybe even a waste of money that could be used for something more necessary and useful. People would debate an argue over what is best and the arguing would be a waste of time all on it's own. Everyone has their own opinion. Everyone wants to be heard.

It may just be easier to save the money. Though you will never know what you are missing out on until you try. So, why not try to apply this program to the schools. It could be a huge success. We could have a completly new and updated experience of life. If mankind has gotten this far without it, could you imagine where we would be with it? ",4
09f2c09,I think that this would be valuable because this Facial Action Coding System really work because in the text it stated that they found out what was Mona Lisa moods. And they figured it out so if they put the computers in a classroom for kids they will find out if they need help or not. Another reason why i think that this computer is valuable is because it can help out the kids and to see if they need help and to also see what they are struggling with so they can fix the problems that the kids are having. Another reason why i think that the computers coding system is valuable to the classroom is because if they feel sad or anything going on at home or somewhere the computer can tell what is they mood and why they have this mood. I also think that this coding system would be good for a classroom because it can help teachers and what i mean is that if the student is struggling and the teacher dont know why the student is struggling but the coding system do the system can tell the teacher what she need to do to help the student understand i really think this would be good for school all over the world the world need this new technology and it need to help us get through school. This concludes my reason on why i think that the technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom are valuable.,2
09f7d1f,"This story is about a new technology that is called a Facial Action coding system that are able able to recognize other people faces. I'm explaining what I think about people using a facial recognition. This whole facial recognition thing is awesome and I think that it is safe for us humans. These people can actually use it for there iphones now. For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device.

The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology. I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea. Another reason why I think this is a cool idea is because it knows who you are even when you have on different face expression. That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that. I some time ask myself how do they do that.

I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.

This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple.

This story told me alot. It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing. I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology. That story was interesting and I think that I would probably use that one day. If I would use it I would be careful with it. ",2
09fc519,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an excellent idea. It would allow schools to make classes more enjoyable for students. Teachers would know if the students are understanding the lessons. Teachers could know if students are stressing and help them calm down. The software would help provide better data for researchers. The program would benefit both students and teachers. It would also make getting data for research easier.

With the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. The program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" The F.A.C.S could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

The software could help researchers collect better data faster. Researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. They could just take it from the program directly. This could help them improve the technology and make it more efficient. The information would help in other studies regarding schools or students. It could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

The F.A.C.S would make the classrooms of schools better. They could make students safer. The schools could receive better feedback on what works and what does not. Researchers would get better information for studies. The systems would benefit more than just one. ",4
0a01969,"Technology is constantly changing and adapting with the times. Some people fear change and loss of control with autonomous technology, especially cars; however, technological control can actually improve the safety of driving in the future. Driverless cars will help to improve the quality and safety of driving around the world.

Driving safety is a prevalent issue in many parts of the world. People face daily dangers on the road, such as texting drivers, drunk drivers, and drivers that are too exhausted to focus; with autonomous cars, these dangers would be removed. The driverless cars would use multiple sensors to form continuously updated 3-D models of the car's surroundings, which would allow the car to substitute for a human at the wheel. Critics might argue that it is unsafe to rely purely on technology to drive people.

However, the cars would not be purely autonomous; the car would alert the human driver if he or she needed to take over. Several large car companies, including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, are already planning to release cars that are capable of driving themselves by 2020. Rapid technological improvements are allowing cars to become more refined and to take over multiple tasks that were originally done by human drivers. These cars and their sophisticated technology vastly improve the safety of driving on the road.

Driverless cars would not only improve safety on the road, but would also improve the safety of the environment. Currently, cars use up millions of gallons of gas each year, causing pollution and severely impacting the quality of air in many city environments. However, autonomous cars could be used as replacements for current taxi systems. Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, believes that the use of driverless cars in place of taxis would greatly reduce the amount of air pollution as well as the consumption of gasoline; the cars would use half the amount of fuel that taxis currently consume. Driverless cars would improve the safety of the world.

It has been proven multiple times that these cars will improve the safety of driving around the world; unfortunately, the road to driverless cars is still blocked by laws and by people's fears. If people allow it, autonomous technology in cars will have a huge positive impact on the future.",4
0a0388e,"Dear senator Im arguing in favor of keeping the Electoral collage. It has come to my attencion that people want to change it to election by popular vote for the president of U.S. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it makes more sense and is easier for you guys to count the votes. It is more orginized by level of the voting people lie president, vice president ect.

The Electoral vote consists of 538 electors. The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.

I just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government. This only happens Every 4 year so you got to wait a long time.

I am very imform about this and making a change will only make thinks worse. People are not going to get use to doing another way or they are gonna get confuse with the old one. It going to be a caus if you change it. I just want to make thing better not worse. So you maybe want to consider this more and think about for days and analyist real good.

0a07f07,"A world of less pollution, less costly wages, reduced congestion on the roads, healthier ways to venture around, and less stress and danger. That would be a world with limiting car usage. May not seem like a rational idea but when you see all the good that could come out of the reduction of cars on the streets it could change your way of thinking.

A city in Germany by the name of Vauban, 70 percent of their families do not desire to have cars. Over half of the percentage of people had sold their cars just to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Those were the words of a women by the name of Heidrun Walter who is a mother of two and is also a media trainer she finds bicycles and sound of children running about is a much more tolerant tone then the sound of a motor rolling by. The enviromentalists from the Enviromental Protection Agency favors the idea of car reduction. They stand for cars being limited would reduce pollution and be more friendly the mother earth. From the reduction of cars on the roads the congestion percent soared down a plump number of 60 percent. That's truely a magnificent amount.

I strongly believe that limitng the car usage would reduce death rates, reduce smog, put people in less tense moods keeping them more happy, and lastly reduce moeny going to greenhouse gas wages. More places worldwide should limit relying so much on cars, to allow us to function in daily life without them.    ",3
0a0d3b4,"The Face is a natural landform and not an alien monument. On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.

Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Also, NASA showed the image for all to see, and the caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The answer is yes the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon.

But, few of us scientists believe the Face is an alien artifact. On April 5,1998, scientist, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Face to prove there was no alien monument. When the Face image was finally posted, anxious web surfers saw that it was revealed as a natural landform and no alien monument at all. Everyone wasn't satisfied. Skeptics were saying that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.

On April 8, 2001, we drew clse enough for a second look. One scientist said, ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A scientist, Gavin, once said "" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

The Face is just a natural lanform and not alien monumument at all. I think this because we all have taken pictures and used evidence as to why the Face isn't an alien monument. I hope everyone agrees with me and all the other scientists because the proof that we've given is reasonable.                       ",4
0a0f7cc,"The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars but the negative aspects are more compelling. Driverless cars require many sensors, they would still require the help of the human driver and there is always the possibility of the technology failing and cause injury.

The driverless cars that are being tested require many sensors that are needed in order to allow the car to perform the duties of drivering. As it says in the article "" For starters, they needed a whole alot of sensors."" It rises questions like, What if they fail? What would be the cost of replacing broken ones? It a sound too expensive to maintain. Is there an alert system to warn humans a sensor is going out? As driverless cars need sensors they still need the help of the human drivers.

They claim to be driverless cars and yet they arent completely driverless; they still need the asistance of the human drivers. In the article is says "" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" and ""... but all are designed to nofity the driver when the road ahead requires human skills..."" In how many situations would the so called driveless cars need the human skills to operate and prevent accidents? There is still the need for human judgement.

With automatives there has always been the risk of injury and death which is present in the driverless cars. But who would be at fault as the article says, ""... new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accidents. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-- the driver or the manufacturer?"" Car manufacturers have been in fault for car defects that have resulted in injury or death. With driverless cars the risk could go up with failures in the car.

Even though the thought of having driverless cars is appealing to many, there is many negative aspects to the idea of having them. As driverless cars require many sensors, they would still require

help of the human driver and is always the possibility of the technology failing and cause injury or death. We are still far from the day where people will see driverless cars as an everyday thing.",3
0a0f8b3,"My position on driverless cars is that they should be used when needed not all the time. They are not as safe as people think they are for the fact that they cannot think for themselves. They will have to have way to many sencersto be able to try to keep every one safe. Safty is a big concern because of all the sencers that are there and one of them go out the othere sencers cant see that spot so if something were in that spot then they would have died.

Some people think smart cars are going to be the next big thing but i dont hink so safty and money are way out of the safty range at the moment and i dont think it is a very good idea because where are you going to get all the money to buy a smart car, I know i would not have enough money for that because i dont have money for a regular car at the moment because wll i just got my job. Just take a minute and think would you want your child playing on the street and this driverless car comes through that same street and the sencer on that part of the car is not working and it does't see your child and runs he\she over?

So in conclusion, Smart cars are not as smart as they seem. They will not be cheep cars to have and if they get themselfs into an accident think of all the money that you would have to

put into it to fix all of the damage that it would have caused itsself. Think about the insurence bill if it accidentaly kills someone because one of the sencers were out. I think that they would bee good to have if you are sick but not any other time i think it would be stupid to even try to have them but that is my opionion on the matter i just wouldn't buy one because i do not wat to be responsible for something tragic happening to anythingor anyone.

0a22908,"The author of this work is in favor of taking on the great challenge of landing a ""rover"" on Venus for research and exploration. Venus has many extreme conditions that the earth does not have to endure. The author presented many ""solutions"" to these problems. Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best.

Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.

An additional idea that was brought up by the author was ""Silicon electronics."" Siliscon electronics would be resistent to the harsh conditions on the planet-- for a while. The systems would run for about a month before total failure. these silicon systems are very expensive to bein with and are still in the development phase here on earth. Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture. And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented.

Lastly, a ""cave-man"" idea of mechanical computers came into play. These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.

The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet. The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical. A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best. Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with machanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings. Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp. Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question.

Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes. After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure. The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space.  ",6
0a238c3,"Driverless cars have been in all of our minds since television and moives have put them there. Google has had driverless cars since 2009, but are they safe to be in one. While haveing a driverless car seems epic it does have some downfall to it. Driverlesss cars , or smart cars, are a bad idea because it cost a large amount of money, a driver must be on the wheel and on alert at all times, and it even has problems with the law.

Driverless cars in the late 1950s had to run on a special track. The smart-road systems worked well. It was actully a succesful test, but it would have require massive upgrades to the existing roads. The roads would be too expensive to upgrade. So instead of smart-roads they moved on to smart cars. The smart cars would need a lot of sensors to work. The senors would of course become more advance, but so well the cost.

Although the smart cars cost a large amount it also still needs a driver at the wheel. The car can handle speeds up to 25mph, but the sensors make sure the dirver hold on to the wheel. Even though it is a smart car none of the cars can go without a driver at the wheel. The car would need a driver for roads it can't navigat thourgh. Such as work zones and around accidents. The car can not navigat thourgh these places which is why it alerts the driver that the need to take control of the wheel. To improve this the manufacturers put cameras in the smart car to watch driver. They make sure that the driver is focused on the road. If there is a road the car needs help with, it would vibrate the seat to alert the driver.

Even if the car can alert the driver the law focus on on how focused the driver is. In some states it is illegal to test a computer-driven car. Such states worry the the car would cause an accident to the passengers, and pedestrians. If the traffic laws change it would still need to cover liability of the accident. So if the car fails and caused an accident would the driver or manufacturer be at fault.

So in the end driverless cars are a horribly idea. They would cost a large amount of money. As well as they are not actully driverless and needs someone to be there, and they are agist the law at some states. Driverless cars should just stay in television and moives.",4
0a28113,"I think the Facial Action Coding System to identify human emotions is not a good idea because some people might be keeping things from other people that might make them sad, mad, or disgusted about someone and then there will be a problem with those people.

This might be a bad thing because it could cause conversy with people and might split people apart from there family, friends, or co-workers. For an example if two people are in a relationship and if one person is disgusted, mad, or sad and the other might ask what they are disgust, mad or sad at the other personor something. And because they did Mona Lisa it doesn't give an good example and it only shows the positive side and if did this on a high school student like they want to it might show more of a negitive responsed.

But in other terms this could be a good thing for some people because it could help people with what they are going though in there life. This could also possible lower the number's of cuicide percent for some places and mostly for people. It could lower places cuicide rates by if they mad, disgusted or sad people could ask what they are though and maby get that thing of there cheat could be a good thing for them. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and2 percent angry"" this shows that it does indeed work and if were going to do it a different person or painting you will get different percent's that will better understand what some people might be going though in life.

A driverless car is exactly what it sounds like. It has a nice ring to it, right? Some people may think it sounds super dangerous, some people might find it quite amusing. Others feel like we are okay with the cars that we have. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. What's yours?

Humans introduce new technology constantly. From phones to computers, from house appliances to buildings, even cars. What's wrong with cars going through a manufacturer for an upgrade? How many people will by the iPhone 7 when it releases? A Lot. How many of those people have an iPhone 6s Plus already? A Lot. Why can't cars be the same way. I mean, maybe it's a waste of hard earned money, but it's yours.

My personal opinion doesn't really make a difference. Although, I do think they should release them. I think they should release them because they literally have no reason not to. Plus, if they decide not to release them, how's that fair to the people that can afford them who've been waiting? Lots of people are cautious about driving with those cars out on the road. Some are scared, some are outrageously mad. Everyone has in the technology business has to come up with something new before long. Another reason I believe they should be released is because of the research. Driverless cars have driven more than half of a million miles without a crash. If you ask me, that's safer than cars WITH people driving them.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it opens your range of knowledge about the world, so you can learn so much about people's culteres and style, but if you don't like learning about the world there is a lot of time to socialize with your freinds or make new freinds.

anything just like Earth. But we don't know. Yes it would be nice to explore Venus. But what risks will it have.

In paragraph 5 it states "" NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". They are wanting to study to see what it has. Yes Venus is one of the hottest planets more than Mercury. And yet we are wanting to risk in searching and seeing what Venus actually looks like. Venus can also melt any kind of metal. Yet we want to risk because of our curiosity.

0a45f5b,"I think driverless cars sound like a good idea on paper, but in the real world they just are not far enough advanced yet for me to feel safe being in or around one.

They are not even fully driverless yet, a person still needs to be ready to take the wheel at any given time.

However in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potentialy prevent accidents.

I think driverless cars are still a thing of the future and not present.

As much as I think they need work now, I am not against the development of them as they could bring many potential benefits.

In the article it states how movies and television shows have been fascinated with driverless cars for a long time, seeing them as a thing of the future.

I think they still are a thing of the future because they still need a driver to be able to take the wheel at any given time.

The only way I can see them being the safest they can be, is if all cars are driverless and they could interact with each other.

Right now the driverless cars are mostly just assisting like antilock brakes, as stated in pararaph six.

When the technology eventually becomes good enough to be able to fully drive without a driver there are still laws to be discussed.

Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.

I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests.

Then the question comes up about blame in the event of an accident, whose fault is it if a computer is controlling the vehicle?

As of now driverless cars seem to be more trouble than help.

With time I feel that they could become very safe and reliable vehicles with advancements in technology.

There are many manufacturers trying to make driverless cars, at least one of them is bound to make something good eventually.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars should keep being developed, however they still need a lot of work.           ",3
0a48500,"Have you ever heard of the facial action coding system? The facial actions coding system enables computers to identify human emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Pretty cool,right? But is this technology really valuable for students in a classroom? I'm going to give you three reasons as to why i think this technology is not valueable.

Firstly, students have a right to keep their privacy. it might be very embarrasing for a student that wants to keep their emotions private to later find out that teachers know exactly how they feel. Even though by just looking at somebody you can whether someone is happy,sad,mad,and etc. If someone doesn't feel comfortable with their emotions they can seek the help they need. Students might not want to attend school anymore due to the fact that their privacy has been taken away, and at any second they might be questioned about their emotions.

secondally, students attend school to learn. By cutting precious timeout of their day to try and read their emotions many students will not get the learning that is needed. Students will start to get bad grades and fail many classes if they are not learning the right way. Many parents might get upset, because they might not want the their kids to go through this process. If the teachers have the parents permission that would be a whole different story.

Lastly, Many students already go through stress due to having many school assignments and trying to keep their grades in good shape. If teachers put another stress factor on kids it could be very hard on them, and also could lead to depression. This generation if very private with everything that goes on in their daily life activities. I know students will not like everyone knowing about how they all are feeling everyday. Students deserve to be happy or sad without everyone knowing.

This are my three reasons as to why i feel that the facial action coding system is not valueable to students in a classroom. They need privacy, not having many stress in their lifes, and lastly they need their learning time.",4
0a494e5,"The author uses fatcs to support why Venus is a realluy hard planet to study cause landing a humanon the planet will be very difficult and dangerous. In paragraph 3 it says that the planets surface is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than here on earth. So really from what we can tell off what theauthor has said, humans will not even last a second on the planet because it is really HOT.

Why till this day are scientist still trying to discover it more? Well some believe that long ago their was water and that the planet was covered up with oceans just like the earth is today. They speculate that the planet venus had supported life just like the planet we live on, but again they are the second planet away from the sun so they really get burned up and maybe thats why the oceans went away. But today Venus is very similar like Earth because the planet has some very rocky surfaces just like our planet does and stuff andf also mountains. Researchers are looking to see if they can build a suit that would withstand the heat and the acidic clouds the planet has.

The author has used many details and has describe venus in many ways. the author has also compared Venus to Earth despite looks. So really in conclusion i think that going to venus will be very hard to do but its not impossible. If somehow their was a suit that would withstand the heat and acidic clouds than maybe.

0a50c61,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job to prove that Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers that are presented, they do this by giving information based on actual conditions, studies and actual experiences. The author used a combination of all three of these to prove their claim that Venus is worth the danger.

The conditions in Venus are a great mix of specific material. The author thoroughly explains each part of the atmosphere in Venus. The text says that "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify metals."" They are proving that the conditions on Venus would exceed anything that our bodies could handle.

Despite saying this, they make a point when they begin into the discussion of the education it could bring us. In the text it is shown that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet it our solar system."" The author supports his argument very well when they say this. They used a status stand point which gives the author more credibility. He then forms a question within the text, by doing this it brought them the opportunity to show the research they had conducted for this writing piece.

The author brought in the research on the true experiments that were thought up through NASA. He builds up NASA's ideas by explaining to the deepest points, but never hits an oppostion until the next paragraph. When they do this it creates an amazing idea that could have the possibility to work imaged into the readers heads.

They eventually hit the oppostition and shows the down fall with NASA's great plan. They state in the text that "" More importatnly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persoanl despite the risks."" When the author decides to say this they prove the irony of it all. If you can't be up close and personal with the planet then you can't learn the reasons you truly cannot be. From the opposing standpoint it was supported very well once they did that.

They then go back on track to support their claim. They do this by explaining the experiments done in the past. They state a comparison to the readers when they say, "" Just imagine exposing a cell phone tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin,"" This comment that was made impacts the writing positvely. When they do this it gives the readers something to think about or imagine. It brings the issue to them and gives them a chance to relate somehow.

The conclusion that he provides gives a clear closing. He states his claim again and uses his evidence to bring the topic to a point. The closing gives you something to think about, it leaves you wondering about the topic and forming your own opinions. In the conclusion it states, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet te very edges of imagination and innovation."" The right thing is to not starve us from the education that could be provided just because of a dangerous boundary. All of the evidence that they have stated and proven through the whole essay just ends with them eventually just stating that it is the right thing to do.

The author does a good job of proving this through the whole essay.              ",5
0a54018,"I accept driverless cars entirely and base my position on statistics found both within and outside of the passage: ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"". The facts I base my opinion and position on driverless cars are: all of the accidents the Alphabet (formerly Google's vehicle) Driverless Passenger Mobile Vehicle were caused by human drivers alone. The second reason is because the vehicles have instant, high speed, and highly accurate radius road mapping systems to navigate safley for both the passengers and other drivers and passengers.

I very much disagree with the sentence found in the passage: ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009"" in paragraph 2 because there are very few conditions that the vehicle could ever function under even in the 2009 model's developed.

I also disagree with the first line in the passage which states: ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cards because no one needs them anymore?""; although specifically ground vehicles that match the appearance of cars may be unavailable for direct transportation, most humans will rely on some form of direct vehicular control as the human inovation proccess brings more variety to forms of transportation, there will always be a time gap between the development of self controlling functions in vehicles and the manufacturing of the vehicles themselfs. We will move on, but we will always at some point be in control of some transportation directly as we progress through the newer types of transportation such as recycleable aerospace vehicles and extra-atmospheric transportation manufactured by SpaceX.

To conclude, I believe that taking the step to accept driverless vehicles as they are in post-testing phases is a healthy and natural nessesity for humans to take to allow for greater inovation as it is manufactured. Driverless vehicles are proven to be safer and are heavily misunderstood. Most of the government organizations that take time away from proper conduct of ensuring the safety of drivers with improved motor ways on the world to focus on neglecting innovation and progression of mankind lack the basic leading skills they are required to have to allow for better and newer mechanics.",4
0a62a7a,"For many years, the automobile has become and remained a staple in the world as humanity's most popular choice of transportation. The number of cars manufactured by car companies has reached the hundreds of millions. Cars have been a trademark of American ingenuity and the evolution of technology. However, as we go into the great beyond that is the future, we must take into consideration the pains and risks of these vehicles, and if they are worth driving as the world population exceeds seven billion.

Few people can recall a time where global warming wasn't the main conflict of scientists today. The Earth gets warmer as pollution levels rise as smog around cities like Paris and Mexico City reaches an all time high. The polar caps are melting at a rapid rate as hurricanes ravage the mainland harder and harder each year. What caused this stuff to happen? Why, look no further than our friends, the factories and automobiles! These two have been quoted time and time again as the catalyst of the global warming crisis. With such an adverse effect on the ozone layer, governments around the world have to do something to stop it from rising any further, with nothing short of success. Places like France have realized the extreme rise in smog levels in the city of Paris, that they had to do something. So, they made a ban on driving for people with even numbered license plates with only a few exceptions, and banned odd numbered licensed cars the next to try to curtail this occurance. After a few days, it worked. The smog cleared just enough for the French government to rescind its ban on license plates for the city. Such a huge difference in smog in only two days means that making a ban similar to this could be nothing short of beneficial for communities around the globe. So why don't more communities take up the hard task of making this ban a regular happening? It's a slow process, but it is happening, in unlikely places. Including over in our Western European ally Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a small community town located near the border of France and Switzerland. This town is best known for it's extremely unorthodox method of removing greenhouse gases from the ozone layer. People have decided to give up their cars, just relying on other transportation like walking and taking a local tram. Street parking, driveways and home garages are just not allowed in the district, and this has caused a huge difference between non-car owners and car owners alike. Seventy percent of the population in Vauban does not own a motor vehicle, a large portion of them sold their cars to move out to this small, cozy little town. Busy sidewalks and the chatter of civilians outshines the faint murmurs of the few odd automobiles in the city. What started out as an odd social experiment has turned into a great community full of happy people. Although this type of community is generally unpopular, other countries around the world have come to like the idea Vauban came up with. The capital city of Colobia, Bogota, has a neat program they like to call the Day Without Cars. The title speaks for itself. Civilians would take one day out of the year to generally not use cars, to promote the likening of taking other modes of transportation to wherever you need to go. Countries in South America have noticed this day, and are looking to replicate it themselves, which ultimately signifies the success of the Day Without Cars.

Countries around the world have all tried to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, whether by making a community built around the non-use of cars, making a day celebrating the use of other modes of transportation, or just banning the driving of automobiles outright. As just of a cause it may be, Americans are still hesitant to enact such henious laws. However, if more communities are built around this clean idea, more and more people will flock to it. It just takes preserverence, a strong plan, and a whole lot of sidewalks.    ",4
0a67e11,"Hello Senator of the state,

I think we should change the Electoral College to the election by popular vote because whats really the point in having people vote for president if it doesn't contribute hardly any to which person gets elected?

The Electoral College in highly unfair to voters simply because of the winner-take-all system. Voters vote for a slate of electors to choose instead of the president him/herself. Although the electors could be anyone not holding public office. Sometimes State Convetions, State Party's Central Committee, and sometimes the Presidential Candidate's themselves choose the electors. Which also is not fair because they could choose a party who favors them and their party to win, or help the president win the election. In

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong mentions ""The single best argument against the Electoral College is what we might call the 'Disaster Factor.' ... Back in 1960, segregationist in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy) Perhaps not worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, in that case the State Delegate would vote on the president and the senate would choose the vice-president.

But on the flip side there are ""five reasons for retaining the Electoral College regardless of it's lack of domocratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""

Certainty Of Outcome

- a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.

Everyone is President

- a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states because he wouldn't gain electoral votes in states he already won over, so he went to other regions to try to win them over to gain more electoral votes.

Swing States

- the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates.

Big States

- other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

Avoid Run-Off Elections

- the Electoral College avoids problems of elections in which no candidiate receives a majority of the votes cast.

It can be argued that the Electoral College is the better route to go but it could cause voters to turn away on voting for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, and knwoing their vote will have no affect they will have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.

0a7fbd0,"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satifyied with the whole process. Show we ""abolish"" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesnt matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winner-take-it-all basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College (301 and 370 elector votes exactly). When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College.

what is the callage electoral ?

the electoral collage is a compromise between electing a president by voteing in congress and election of the president by how many popalar vote for qualified as to be a president.

teh electoral has many process such as meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

oto be elected for president u need to have a majority of 270 electorals votes cause the electoral callage consists of 538 electors under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbai is allocated 3 electors and trated like a statte for purposes of the electoral collage.

pretty much each candidate running for president in any state has his or her own group of electors.

any president thats running for election is held every fore years on the tuseday after the first monday in novermber.

most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winninfg presidential candidate.

elctoral collage they're not alone according to a gullup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage won the popular.

the problem with electrola collage is that under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

thje singel best argument against the electoral collage is whtat we might call the disaster factor. we consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electtors.

perhaps most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. and the election would br thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in eavh state, bcandiadates dont spend time in state they know they have no chance of winninf-g, focusinfg only on the races in the swing states.

collage method of selcting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a sinle vote may decide a n election.

in my conculesion we should change the election by who has most popular votes for the president of the untied states, because it make more scence the election always go by votes and who ever have the most votes is elected for the president of the untied state. the eletoral collage system wasnt that good to many things going on i mean like it was kinad of good but not better then election on popaler votes.

If we limited car usage, it would be easier to get to our destination. Places would be more compact with less space for parking so that stores would be built close enough for us to walk there rather than driving to the nearest mall. Less malls would mean less parking lots, meaning sotres would be built along main streets rather than a highway.

Not only does less cars make it easier to get to the places we need to be, but makes people happier. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, a city in Germany, limited car usage making their streets ""car-free"". Making streets car-free made people way happier, since they are usually tensed when having a car.

Limiting car usage would help the environment. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States? Imagine how polluted it must be in New York where the main streets are congested with cars!

In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris bans driving to clear the air. Congestion was down 60% in France. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France which pollutes the air big time.

0a919e7,"I think we should keep the electoral college because it at least gives people a say on weather or not the person they vote for gets elected or not, people always say that you can't complain if you don't vote, so I'm sure people wouldn't want to not be able to vote. I'll explain in more detail my reasonings in the next couple of paragraphs.

The first reason for keeping electoral colleges is because people want a say on who's president. America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the pesident is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big desions such as a presidental election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are use to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and the people complain louder than they do praise.

Another reason why they shouldn't take away electoral colleges is because of the amount of complant they would get from everyone if they do decide to take electoral college away. It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless.

Those are basically the two big reasons why voting should be avalable to everyone, and not just left up to sentators and stuff. People want a say on who's running their country and because there will be tons of complaining if voting is taken away from them. So, think before you make a drastic desison like that.    ",2

Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on surface. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography the dense videography ineffective. Venus is so hot that it can melt metal.",1
0a9488d,"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""  If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well.    ",6
0a94ac7,"""Mom im going to go outside to get some fresh air"" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean.

Its polluted.

But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a mother of two . She walks verdant streets & love listening to her surrounding.

But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on.

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.     ",2
0a98eef,"The new technology to read students emotional expressions is a very helpful idea.Now we will be able to know when someone is losing intrust, or becoming bored.The process begins when the computer contrusts a 3-D computer model of the face. The Facial Axtion Coding System enables coputers to identify human emotions.

WOW!

We can actually ""calulate"" emotions-like biology homework. The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.It would be able to idenitfy six

basic emtions- happiness, suorise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

In the class room your not always happy,but maybe if sombody or somthing knew that you wasn't

happy it could change that. The new technology should be put in class room to help the unhappy student be happy or at least try to make them happy. I say this because when you not happy then you don't really feel like doing any school work.So maybe the new technology can help change you or your attitude.

To a Human facies don't lie, for instance you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there face.Alot of us would have diffrent feelings but are face show diffrent.

The reason why the the Facial Action Coding System would be bad idea for school is the cost. Where will the school get the money from for them to get this high technology from. Who will be the paying for them. If somthing was to brake on the Facial Action Coding System it would cost a arm and a leg to get it fixed just because the high technolgoy used to make it.

We need these in the class room! if we had the new technology in the class room we love it ,because when you get bored the technology would recoernized that and will swicth to something else.If you are still un happy the technology will know and will keep switch to it see a change in emoition.If you are still un happy the technology could even put up a smiling face to make you smile, because sometimes all you need is a good smile.

I think the new technolgy is a good resource for the classroom and can really help and improve the education in the class room.",3
0a99d52,"My Position on driverless cars is i am not for driverless cars at all. Driverless cars are another thing that will make this country become more lazy and more careless. Sergey Brin the cofounder of google believes it will changes the world fundamentally, no this will not again this will make the whole lazy and careless and say they get in a an accident who do you blame the car the driver the padestrian? Driverless cars will make The world not a better place but a place where everyone is too obese or lazy to do anything. Driverless cars are also verry dangerous as well as stupid.

Driverlesss cars are dangerous becuase you wont know what to expect from the car. You wont know if the car will make a wrong turn break down out of no where,shut off completely or maybe even blow up at some point. Driverless cars are also very dangerous becuase they will not no what to do with all the oil they may not need any more, where are you gonna get rid of it , dump it in a river, ocean; no absolutely not. This is also not gonna be benefitical to gas companies or the goverment because where does all the money that we will usually spend on gas go that will go the goverenment, it will go to our familes and friends and be able to buy nice stuff for ourselves and not have to pay the government who already doesnt benefit the United States of America.

Driverless Cars are pointless and will not give us any benefits for our lives.

Again, My opinion is Driverless cars are very pointless and the will not benefit the US. It will only be destructive and a waste of time. It will also be another reason Americans will soon become obese and lazy, more than it is now. Finally, Whats your opinin about this?",3
0a9df6a,"Have you ever been in a car accident or close to one ? Do you remember if it was your fault or not? What if it wasn't ? There have been talk about driverless cars , and with these cars there would still be need of driver assistance. These cars could cause numerous accidents. Would they still be your fault? If you got in one of these ""driverless cars"" you would be accountable for any damage done because you were supposed to be alert while riding in this driverless car.The development of driverless cars should cease because the car still needs human assistance,the car is not safe and the car weakens drivers alertness.

Driverless cars are not what they seem,false advertisement, you still have to drive them at some point. An article says that these cars are unable to direct through traffic or pull out of drive ways, the complicated things. If the car unables the driver to get out of doing the complicated work ,why have one ? The article also states the car is supposed to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Drivers do not need another human to take the wheel they can do it themselves, drivers need advanced technology to take the wheel , because all humans make mistakes, technology does not. Driverless cars are not good on highways because what if there is an accident on the highway and the driver is not alert, the car does not know how to detour its way around.Driverless cars are supposedly good on ""smarter roads"" , not every road is a smart road. What are people who live in congested city and construction

areas supposed to do? The driverless car is not a good product , it is obviously useless to most people because of the rules and regulations with this car.

Think about your life ,who would you blame for an ingury if you had a driverless car mishap? Certainly not yourself one would hope, driverless cars are extremely dangerous if you think about it , the inventers, google, thought of this car. The car is supposedly to be driverless but it is not, the car requires human assitance from time to time.In a case of a driver falling asleep and not hearing the alert of the car could result in a major incedent .The warnings google came up with to alert the drivers were vibrating seats, and flashing windshields that can not be seen if a driver is asleep. If a driver gets in one of these cars and then gets in a non-driverless car they will be left feeling that that can just fall asleep at the will and this will cause more problems.

Driverless cars will weaken a drivers alertness and decrease the probablity that they will stay focused enough to get behind a wheel when it is needed.Drivers need to be alert regardless if they are driving or not , because another driver in another car could not be alert and that could result in an accident.

0aa8caf,"I think that driverless cars are good and bad. A car that navigates its own self, doesn't need a driver to take control of it, uses less fuel, and is controlled by a computer is most likely to be our future. We all want to do greater things, invent grather things, but we should also realize that some things can be thought of but not created. A driverless car has its ups and downs because if no human being is in control it could represent a bad aspect or a bad one. One good thing that comes to the top of my head is elderly people. This would be really useful to the elderly, especially because of muscle or bone aches. It reduces the number of crashes but could also influence them. The computer or whatever is controlling the car could misfunction or something could go wrong, therefore the car could end up crashing or causing an accident. Humans have the most control on a car. They decide the speed, direction, their surrondings. A computer could do thst too but not as acurate as a human would. Yes it is a very interesting thing thst could happen in the future but are we sure that we would want a machine to take over rather than a human. There are lots of arguements that can be done about this. Some people may agree, some people may not and thats fine because we all have different opinions. Driverless cars still have a long way before they can just change what has been achieved for more that maybe 80 years or so, and thats humans having full control.",2
0aa9cee,"I think that the Face is just a natural landform. Just like landforms form on Earth, landforms can form on Mars. Why I say it's just a landform is because, it's just a huge rock formation,it isn't an alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object shown in the picture.

First,the Face is just a huge rock formation. Mars is a rocky planet. Rocks can form any shape they aren't created by humans. There isn't any sign of life on mars so no one could go there and make a face on Mars' surface.

Second, it isn't an alien monument. An alien wouldn't make a human face just for fun. In plus, they wouldn't even know what humans looked like. They wouldn't even know how to get to earth to see what we even look like. So trust me aliens are not real!

Third, Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object showing in the picture. This could prove that there isn't anyone or anything on mars that could've made the face. This could prove almost anything in any picture of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. It's just a huge rock formation, it isn't a alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object in the picture showing.               ",3
0aaae26,"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed.  Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.  The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.  Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.  This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today?  This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.  According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""  This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.  If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.  Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.  ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""  This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.  Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.  This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.  According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?  It only makes sense.  Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)  But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements.  If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?  Will it always produce a clear winner?  What about the event of a tie?  Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.  The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.    ",5
0aae146,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.                              ",6

0ab5467,"Based on what I've read some believe that there's a face on Mars, and it could be linked to extra-terrestrial life. But I don't find this to be truthful here's why. If you look at the picture from 1976 it can resemble a face, but if you look at the 2001 picture it just looks like a landform. Here's another thing, the one from 1998 looks like volcanic activity is emerging, which could be the case. These pictures contain important information, and data that can be analyzed, which will help NASA find out more about this.

Let's go back to the Viking 1 spacecraft. This machine was built in 1976, which could possibly mean the machines camera was broken, or malfunctioning. One major factor in this is NASA. NASA is a company who study's life outside our atmosphere. When they launch probes into space it costs millions of dollars to do so. When they find real life outside our atmosphere they get paid for all the research they've done.

Then there's the rumors that certain people spread around. Usually it's untrue, but there's a possibility that it's true.

0abf87b,"Self driving cars are becoming more and more popular as techology advances making it feel like one day in the future we're gonna just ditch the cars all together and we're all going to be hovering around on hover boreds and there wont be a reason for people to learn to drive. Realizing this makes people wonder if there will one day not be a purpose for a drivers license because techniacally they won't be driving. But with everyone just wanting to be in with the new things in the world no one ever thinks about some of the dangers self driving cars could cause.

One danger people should be extremly aware of is the independance on the vehicle. When people hear the phrase Self Driving Cars they think about something completely different and more advanced than what driverless cars actually are. They instantly assume that they have a free ride to where they want to go and can be oblvious of there surroundings when thats not the case at all. What if there is a malfuction and they have to be ready to take the wheel to keep from drving into a ditch and they arn't. As stated in the article it says ""..the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation comes."" this means that even though people are not driving doesn't mean they can sit on their phone text and expect there not to be any problems because they can't be so dependant on a machine.

Another problem there is with getting the driverless car on the road is the laws that need to be passed to allow them. only three state have allowed them to begin driving on the roads which are ""California,Nevada and Florida"" but even those states keep them on minimum useage for acident prevention. As stated in the article ""..even if traffic law change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" which means that there would be conflicts between owners and manufacturers to see who would be responsible if there were accidents caused by malfuctions.

Now there is a diiference between self driving and autopilot. with autopilot people still understand this as you have to be cautious if though they arn't driving they still have to steer. As stated ""Tesla has projected a 2016 reaease for a capable of drivihng atuopilot 90 percent of the time"" this says that even though it's not self drving you can still drive with little to no driving at all.

Even though it would be cool to have a self drivng car people still need to put safety of themselves and others before buying a driverless car.",4
0ac26e9,"This technolgy of you can calculate the emotions of people just by pretty much just scanning your face is pretty cool. I believe that this is cool to have in classrooms and how teachers can teach us how to use this.

With this technology we can now see her emotion, and with other paintings or artwork just like this. We can now connect to the artist who made it.

Another reason why I think we should use emotional expressions is because in the past we really can't know what a person is feeling. You can try and hide it or you can put on a fake smile and everyone believes it. We can use the emotional expressions to prevent sucide. 8th grade to 12th grade, everything is changing your friends, your family, your school, and your teachers.

While helping so many people i was able to see Europe and China. While in Italy I took a ride in a Venice, Italy a city with streets of watere. It was amazing not only did i see amazing places but I was able to work with a lot of amazing animals.

It took to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the east coast of the United States and a mouth to get to China. But carry for the aniamls took a lot of work. I had to feed them and clean up there mess. But working in my Aunt Katie's farm when i was younger helped me a lot.

0ac8051,"Dear Senator,

Pensive and melancholic, the debate on whether or not the Electoral College should be kept has had the people thinkinf for many years now. As you already know the process of the Electoral College consists of electors meeting and voting for the president and vice president. Therefore, the people voting only help choose the state's electors when voting for their president. In reality, we all know that when we vote we are actually choosing our candidate's electors. Because of this the people feel like their voice isn't being heard. They believe that they aren't actually voting for their president.

For starters, the majority of people, over 60 percent of the voters, would prefer a direct election instead of having an Electoral College. Under the system we have now voters can't always control who their electors vote for. Sometimes there is a problem where we choose the wrong elector and in turn vote for the incorrect candidate. The majority of people voting feel that their vote does not really count because electors can go against what they promised, and they can vote for whoever they wanted to vote for.

In addition to this, there is a problem if there is a tie in the electoral votes. In the event of this the election would be passed to the House of Represenatatives. This means that it is up to state delegations to vote on the president.    ",2
0acad9f,"The face on Mars as believed by many is not a face but a mesa explained ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". There are many reason to support this. Such as in 1998, Nasa reveled that it was just a landform. Yet there are many who are not satisfied.

In April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The MOC or Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Viking photos that was ten time larger. The first picture of it revealed that it was a natural landform and there were no alien monument. Although it was winter and cloudy the picture was not mistaken since it was ten times larger than the Original.

Then, in April 8, 2001, it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. MGS or Mars Global Surveyor was close enought for another look. The team captured an amazing photo using the Camera's maximum Resoultion. The photo also revealed that the picture shows a butte or mesa which is a lava dome. The article clearly states that the Face on Mars is a mesa.",2
0acae1e,"The election of a president is a very seriouse thing that could ruin us or improve us we should start to pay attention to Mister State Sentor it could make a future for some people or cause war between people. We should change the system were people can vote for there president not there state electors. Plus, some people don't know this is going on they belive that they are voting for the person to change the state not an candaite of the president.  We should not have people who don't know what there doing in congress and that we don't have segergation in the state.

To start off with, we should not have people we don't know there doing in the congress. In source 2 it states that,'' ... that they can be anyone note holding a public office .... some times state convention ,sometimes the state party's centeral commitee, sometimes the presidental canidates themself'', that is very bad that they can just choose anyone off the streets and don't care, this could be bad for the economy the people thee took off the streets they might not even know how to do there job because they were not trained to do such things, and then they have patry's centeral commitee,or the state convention we should have a direct vote not other people who might not be even on our side and want only power.

Next, we dont want segregation in the state, it casually states that,'' segregationists in te louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in the replacing the democratic electors with new electors that oppose of a Jhon kenndy'', If that have happened then we would be in chaos everyone would be aginst each other and there will be alot of pain and suffering for the people because of there race,and religous belife we would no longer be a great nation.

To conclude my essay, that we should not have strangers we don't know or don't even hold a office in our conress to be a state ellector that don't know what ther doing that is how we end up with alot of wars or no money and that we don't have segergation in the state that can lead into more problems .

The best arguments in favor of it are mostly asserations without much basis to start in reality...''.    ",3
0acfeeb,"The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged, as well as ""faithless"" electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.

In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. This cannot represent the will of the people.

Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards ""swing states."" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.

The Electoral College dosen't hear the voice of the people, hardly plays by the rules, is something that should be erased. Even people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dale, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree, give the voice back to the people and abolish the Electoral College!    ",4
0ad0588,"Facial expressions can tell a lot about you, but do you really know what your facial expression is actually showing? Well being all about the new technology will tell you a lot about your self. Being about the technology will tell you about facial expressions, how the muscles in your face can tell how you really feel, and how the technology works for people. This technology will tell how a person really feels.

Facial expressions can tell a lot about a person and how they might feel. When someone is frowning others may think that your mad or sad. But when someone is smiling others may think that they are happy or excitied. Facial expressions can tell a lot about people but noone really knows what the true facial expresson is. When a person is happy they might simle, when a person is scared they might make a frightened facial expression. Each facial expression means something different.""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."".

Muscles on your face tell what expression a person is using. Someone who is smiling muscles are shaped different from when they are sad or mad. Depending on how you feel is the way your muscles are shaped. ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above our eyes) raises your eyebrows when your surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."", said Dr. Paul Eckman.

You may be wondering how this technology works and what it really does. Well ""this process begins when the vcomputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."". ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit.."". "" There are six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fera, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" By weighting different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions, meaning that the weight of it can tell. Each one of the expressions that are used are compared to neutral faces.

Imagine if a computer can tell weather your confused or mad or even sad. What if when it could tell what facial expression you was meaning it woud change to your intrest. This technology could help a lot of people. For an example it could help school kids become more intrested in school work if it could tell you was bored and made it more intresting. By showing the students facial expression this technoloy can better the student just by changing it into something that makes it better for them.",3

The author of this article gives us evidence that scientists are still trying to find a way to land on its surface. Why? They know it's a dangerous misson, they know somebody could get hurt.

Venus's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which blankets the whole planet. The average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience. Scientists should know that if they try and send a spacecraft full of men to Venus and land they are risking lives. Scientists want to study the planet on how it used to be, they belive it used to be just like Earth and it could've supported living things.

The surface of the planet has similar feautures that resemble our valleys, moutains and craters. NASA has one exciting idea for sending a spacecraft back but it would take time and money from the government.

Drivers and passengers could get injured, the technology could malfunction, and the cars are not completely driverless. The car would not be completely safe for the drivers or anyone else in the car.

First, people in the car could be seriously injured. If there is no way of knowing

who's responsibilty it is that someone is injured there could be many problems. Someone could be injured in the car because they don't have as much control over the car as a regular car would. A person who is hurt in this car could end up with a lot of problems. People in the driverless car could be injured.

Second, the car could malfunction. Malfunctions of the car could lead to many problms.The driver could be driving down the road and something happens with the technolgoy and the driver loses control of the car. If the car is about to hit something and it doesnt let the driver know it needs to take over, the car could crash. The driverless car could malfunction and cause wrecks or injuries.

Third, the car is not completely driverless. The driver still has to control the car if needed. The driver may not be paying attention when they need to take over. This could cause the driver to not be fully ready to stop the car. They may not stop fast enough and crash into another car or object. Not being a completely driverless could be a big issue for not only the owner, but the manufacturers as well.

Driverless cars should not be used in the future. They could cause injuries, the car could malfunction, and the car is not completely driverless. It may not be completely safe for the driver or the passengers in the car. Many problems can occur from using the driverless car. ",3
0ada1e2,"Dear, Florida Senators

I believe that the Electoral College is a good way of voting for a President and Vice President because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by  a single vote in Congress. The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there President and Vice President. Plus the majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President of the United States. The United States entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One each of the memebers in the House of Representives plus two of your Senators. In our state, each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a President and Vice President of there chose. Some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for President or Vice President. Our state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. '

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If I lived in Texas, for example, and wanted to vote for [Adam] Pis , I'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Pis. On the note, that those electors won the statewide election, they would goto congress and Pis would get 34 electoral votes. There are a lot of questions that people ask, who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so, it must depends what state the citizen lives in.

Perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Its hard to think about this but some are right, abolish the electoral college!

0adafa7,"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore""? As said in the being of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the question is simple. I can say without a doubt that I can invision diverless cares in the future. Although I can hope for sooner rather than later that is one aspect I can not yet answer.

As I have already stated in the previous paragraph that I can invision this future, but I also support this future. The era of perfectly calculating autonomous cars would be an era of complete safety on roads. The driverless cars not being subjected to human errors would not make the foolish mistakes that a human might make in situations like slick roads, alcoholic influence, and peer preasure. The only flaw with autonomous car that I can visualize is the possible glitches in it's programing that could be prevented with annual mantainance. As said in the article ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"" Although I do not see a public transport system being the only use of these cars I can agree with the amount of options and the decrease of polution put into our daily life styles.

In the end I fully agree with the use of driverless cars no matter what the primary use is for. With only minimum tolerance for errors in todays technology I do not see the likelyhood of an accident due to the fualt of the car. Although, as the article states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault"". I refute this statement just as the article did it's self by saying ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved"".",3
0add2dc,"In this passage it talks about how Venus is a challenging planet to study despite its proximity to us humans. it also talks about the danger about it. ""Venus surface has the hottest temperature of any other planet."" here is one reason why its dangerous. but there is also good reasons. ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" this is good because then scientists can be able to make those electronics and send them to Venus without making any of those electronics stop working.

The author gives good reasos in the passage. for example in the passage it says ""scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to udnerstand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This shows how researchers will work on thier machines to make them last loner to contribute to their knowledge of Venus. Another thing that the passage says is ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This explains how they will come up with something to avoid some dangers of Venus.

I think its a good idea too because at the end of the passge it says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" this makes me think back to the beginning too because it says ""Numeros factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challeging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" this makes me think that its not challenging because there could be people who knows some things about Venus and they could try and help with the whole Venus situation. the scientist can maybe later then send rocketships to Venus because it shouldnt limit by dangers and doubts.

0ae1dee,"Many people are not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Many prefer changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States since the Electoral College is unfair. It is. The electoral college is unfair in many ways and we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

One reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote instead of the Electoral College is because the states aren't all equal and electoral college isn't fair. In the Electoral College, California has more of a say than Georgia. California has 55 electoral college, while Georgia has 16. How is that fair? ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" (Plumer 13). This line tells us that candidates stay out of states that they know they won't win. Say there was a candidate campaigning, they will most likely focus on the states that have the most electoral college, like California or Texas. They won't go to states that only have three votes. That's not fair to the states that have a small population. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 6). If electoral votes wasn't a thing, Gore would be president. He's the candidate that won most popular votes, meaning that he got the most votes in the nation. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). Not always? What's the point of voting if the vote won't even count?

Another reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote is because the popular vote will be more precise and it's much easier. There could be less ties, and the candidate that everyone really wants as president will become the president. ""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 16). Gore was the candidate that everyone wanted as president. It just doesn't seem fair that the candidate that won popular vote, isn't or wasn't the president.

Overall, the people should change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States instead of using a system that is unfair to the states and the people.    ",4
0ae3894,"Argument of Driverless Cars.

The article talks about the future of driverless cars which in my opinon is a good idea for people who don't like to drive or are awful at driving and should not be behind the wheel of a car, but for the people who love to drive and get a thrill out of driving this idea is a nightmare to them.

In my opinion if they do make driverless cars they should still make regular cars as well.

Driverless cars are a nightmare to me.

I can't picture a world without driving a car because my whole life all I've wanted to do is drive!

What would happen to people who race cars professionaly?

Would they just sit in the car while the car did all the work?

That doesn't sound fun at all, and I'm sure anyone who has ever raced a car or anyone who still does would agree with me.

In the text it states google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 and have drivenmore than half a million miles without a crash, but what happens when the car possibly malfunctions and kills somebody on the road?

Who are you going to blame then?

At least with a regular ""man driven"" car you have someone to blame it on considering your supposed to have control of your car at all times by law.

The idea of driverless cars completely disobeys the law because you are never in control of your car.

I do believe there can be positives for a driverless car though.

If a blind person is tired of relying on everyone else to take them places they can just hop in the car and tell it where to go.

If a person is handicapped they can get out of the house and view nature at its finest by getting in the car and telling it to go sight seeing.

Or if someone is just a hazzard to everyone and should not be driving a regular car, a driverless car could be better for them and everyone around them.

My conclusion is that driverless cars could be good and bad.

I do believe that they can help with further testing, but I also believe that car companys should still make cars that people can drive if the people love the thrill of driving like I do.   ",3
0aec0b5,"The author gives good reasonings on why the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The first reasoning that the author has is that way back when, Venus might have had open oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Just like Earth does, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar feartures such as moutains, valleys, and craters. NASA has an exquisset idea for sending humans to study Venus. Just picture an enormous blimp-like contraption that hovers 30 or so miles above all of the landscapes, all of the storms, we would be care free. Nothing to worry about except for the drastic temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit that we all would still have to endure while we're there, but no worries we could always just fan eachother with a paper fan.

It 'll work the same I'm sure. We would have solar powered appliences so we wouldn't have to sorry about the everyday hassal of having to plug in, detangle, of trip over any more cords. This would be a major change for all of us drastic in fact, but still survivable. NASA has had some simpified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulated the Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such harsh and mild conditions. NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era.

In clonclusion, NASA has outstanding creations that would be outstandingly suitable for the human race to live on Venus. Worry free, hardly any bills to pay, and all liveable cercumstances.

0aefcef,"Yes, I can see where you are coming from this is because there has been some talk about aliens in the past. Though I can assure you that this is a nautural landform that takes the shape of a face. Sir, I am asking to you please take what I am about to say into consideration. Just listen to me and let me explain to you the scientific proof of how this landoform takes on the label or identity of a face. Yes, I get it with the eyes, nose, mouth, and everything. It is very persuasive to looking like a face. Though it is not an actually face it is a nautural landform that takes the details and characteristics of a face.

I want to draw to your attention that when the face is spotted the shadows of the lanform project onto itself making if look like it has eyes a nose and a mouth. It is just crazy how science works sometimes. But if you just sit and think about it logically it makes sense. But yes, there was a great degree of surprise among our mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. It all came off quite strange. Though when we put it into scientific calulations, the result came back as a nautural landform. And that the eyes, nose, and mouth were just an illusion from the shadows.

Now after hearing all of the scientific calculations, proof, and resonings I hope that you understand where I am coming from. And the fact that it is just a natural landform. Also that it wasn't created by aliens or any other prehistoric creature that claims to live on mars for that matter. Thank you sir for taking the time to listen to my explanations.

0af2d2d,"Driverless cars would increase the safety of driving on roads.

Driverless cars take away issues like human error.

Driverless cars would also reduce crashes, and deathes, involving drunk driving and texting while driving.

These would still be issues, for with all rules some are broken, however with driverless cars the effects of these incidents wouldn't be nearly as costly.

Driverless cars allow for total control of the car at all times, something quite difficult for a human driver to achieve.

Using devices such as the LIDAR and GPS, the car would have complete awareness of its surroundings, while a human driver can only strongly focus on a single direction at a time.

With driverless cars including precautions such as the car alerting the human inside if they need to take manual control of the car, driverless cars are never truly driverless, almost like with an airplane.

There is never only one pilot, the main pilot always has a copilot to take control if there is an issue that the main pilot can't handle alone.

The main causes of car crashes are human error related, such as driving under the influence or texting while driving.

Neither of these problems will have as huge of a cost to them if there are driverless cars involved.

The driverless car will be able to respond to a stopping car faster than a person if they had been texting.

Driverless cars will improve the quality of driving, as well as the safety of driving.

In driverless cars, humans can be productive in other areas, such as doing homework or finishing a file report for a job.

With only limited focus being needed of the human while the car is driving, the human's time can be managed more effectively.

Having a computer drive the car would reduce the number of crashes that occur from drivers falling asleep at the wheel as well as other crash starters.

All in all using driverless cars would greatly increase the quality and safety of being on the road.",3
0af56e8,"This technology to read the emotions and expressions of students in the classroom would be very helpful. Most of the time humans can't tell what a person is feeling and how they will act. With this new technology it could figure out how your emotions are and it could help out the teachers in a classroom to teach a lesson differently based on how some students are expressing their emotions. a person cant read muscles inside a persons face, only a computer can do that and that is what is so amazing about this new technology is that it can do stuff that a person can not do.

This technology could help teachers in the classroom or coaches working on film or a business, to see how all of their workers or their students are reacting to all that is being thrown at them. this benefits the teachers mostly because society has changed so much and alot of stuff is done on computers and they teach alot of lessons off of computers and in the text it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means that whenever a student is sitting there learning the lesson and something comes up and they are very confused they may make a face of confusion and the computer will read that face and the teacher could know how the students felt about the lesson based on the results that the computer came up with when the students were learning the lesson. From there she could help certain students figure something out or teach them an alternative way because now she knows that some kids dont get the material. With this new technology she is able to figure out who is getting the material and who is not and before, she could not figure out if a student was having trouble with the material or not because most of the time students dont speak up and say anything when they are confused because they feel like they are the only ones who are having trouble but with this technology they dont even have to say a word they can just express their emotions and the computer will pick it up. With this new technology it knows what a fake expression is and what is not a fake expression do to the muscles inside your face. In the bottom of paragraph seen it says ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This means that there is no faking out of the lesson, you either understand it or you dont and there is no slipping past it with this new technology.

In the end it makes it easier for alot of people when considering that this technology can do things that people cannot do.

Many emotions can be seen on the face but, students have learned to keep those emotions well hidden with the intention of not wanting anyone to know or find out. Technology being able to determine students' emotion would be extremely benefitial in helping the student fell better and being able to share their emotions.

Using devices to read our emotions would help frowning students smile more when they need it. The computer would be able to read their face by seeing the facial movements and determine whether a student is becoming bored in class. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, having a computer that can read emotions in class "" could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto 6). This could improve the student's learning skills and can help the teacher be notified when and where a student needs help.

This technology would not only be benefitial in the student's school life, but also in his or her personal life too. Computors would be able to see if a student was truely unhappy or upset and would be able to help in a way a human could not. The student may not want anyone to know of their sadness, but a computor knowing is harmless. Depending on the mood, "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto 6). With this technology, when someones is upset, something happy and encouraging could pop up and make them smile. This could brighten a student's mood and encourage them to keep working with a better attitude going out than going in.

The ability to know how someone is feeling without them having to say it could make it easier for people to jump in and help each other out. If one student sees another who was putting on a fake smile, they may be able to encourage them or say something nice to put a real smile on their face. Theory of Emotion, ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses the emotions, but may even produce them"" (D'Alto 9). Putting a smile on someone's face, even for a second, can truely make a difference. This technology would be extremly valuable a student's academic life, to help them to do their best and succeed, and in their personal life, to be more of a light to others.    ",4

The Germas have given up their use of cars. Some residents of the upscale community in Germany are suburban pioneers and a few scoocer moms are the ones who give up their cars. Street parking and driveways are fobidden in some districts. Germans can buy a large garage that cost $40,000 along with the home. 70% of Vauban's famileis don't own cars and 57% sold their cars to move into that distric.

Paris had to ban cars due to somg in their state. On monday motorists with even numbers had to leave their vichle at home if they refused they had to pay 22-euro fine ($31).Almost 4,000 drivers were fined by the international agency headquartered in London. In fact Paris has more somg than European capitals. The somg cleared enough to rescined the ban for odd-numbers on tuesday.

Car free day in Colombia Bogota is a big hit. Three srtight years cars have been baned with only buses and taxis permited.""Rian didn't stop people from participating, said Bogota Mayor Antanas.""For the first time two other cites,Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. The day with out cars is parr of a improvement campian.

Some of the contries are take a step foward to stop gasses from going up into the atmosphere. For instance Paris baned even number licence plates on Monday and ood number on Tuesday. Germany stop using their cxars and some of them say they're happier that way. In colombia Bogota have a day where they can not use their cars unless for buses and taxis.    ",1
0b0644a,"I beileve driverless cars could be a good thing, but need to be throughly tested, even over tested. This isn't some new smart phone, or game system, this is something that can kill someone, even a whole family if the proper precautions are not put in place. As the article says bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays is an excellent way to keep fellow drivers safe of the road, and the sensors on the top of the vehicle looks to be a great tool for safety as well.

With any technology campany, its always about who has the smarter devices, and who can get them out the fastest. I get it, its all apart of marketing, I know. But this is something that shouldn't be sprinted into, this is an advanced, futuristic idea that should not be rushed to the public, but added on, enhanced, and decorated that on theories, but real systems keeping real people safe.

I also can't help to wonder, can these cars go on more narrow, country, or even alley roads? Living in a small town the only normal roads are those that lead of of town and threw it, but all its branches of smaller, and country roads severely out-number the others. Will it mostly go to city people, who have the proper roads, or will it go the small-town people who would have to keep their hands on the steering wheel most of the time?

Another questioned I'd want to ask is with such a relaxing driving experience, what procedures does the car follow when a driver fall asleep? Does it shock him/her, or play loud music, simply say, ""wake up"", or nothing at all? The article mentioned that the smart car GM has come up with, vibrates the seat when about to be backed into an object, could something like that be put into play?

I think the idea and prototypes that are being made about smart cars are a good thing, a smart thing if you will. But I still have my doubts, questions, and worries. But if smart cars can advance to the point without those worries, we could be looking at an entirely new era.            ",4
0b095ea,"He supports his idea with a lot of facts. he also uses a lot of deytails whitch is good because we get a lil bit more of an idea. i get what the athour is saying because if you look at it venus is the second closest to the sun that is why it makes it so hard to land spaceships there. i think that the ships over heat when they are entering venus because it is so hot.

It would be cool if we knew what is in venus because we could find some new minerals or some other stuff. but i think that there no creatures because in paragraph 3 the first sentence talks about how the atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide so that means nothing could be liven there. there is one example for why it is so hard to land ships on venus,m in paragraph 3 it says that the tempature can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit that is way to hot for the ship. and i dont think any human can land on venus do to the heat.

Even though we would risk a lot of chances it would be so cool for us to see what type of things are on venus. on paragraph 7 it says that nasas is working on other ways to study venus i think that it is going to be possible due to all the new technology we have. even though we have ships that hover over venus it is still hard for us to clearly see what is on venus .",3
0b0f882,"In this article the author is telling us that facts about Venus how it's called the ""Evening star"" because it's the ""brightest points of the light in the sky night"" and it is a good place to examine, because of how close it is to the sun and earth, of its tempature, its heat, pressure, and how no spacecraft have landed there. But it's really dangerous in Venus.

It's dangerous in because, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent cardon dioxide blankets venus, their is also clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, on the plants surface temperatures avaerage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then whats in our earth.

And If they were to explore venus NASA would need scientist to survive the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. They would need to make blimp-car like vehicles they need to hover for miles and miles becuase it's is 170 degrees fahrenheit which means they would burn real bad. and the lights need to be real good because they need to penetrate the dense of the atmosphere.

I think they shouldn't explore Venus because it's a suicide mission it's too hot a lot of co2 and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. ",3
0b153d1,"For driverless cars they can have a plus side and a downside. I see that driverless cars can be a good thing for a few reasons. The posistive affects of the driverless car could range between keeping accidences from distractions down and for long trip safety. They can also have a downside. These downsides very from people who like driver to malfunctions in the car.

There are some positives to the driverless car. One of these reasons would be for the drivers that get distracted easily. The drivers wont have to worry about not being able to stay as focused since they will not have to drive. The driverless car can also keep drunk drivers from driving, preventing a big amount of crashes. There are also many more reasons driverless car can be a good thing.

Even with all the positives the driverless car will have some negative effects and problems. There will always be drivers who would prefer to drive and feel safer that way, in some cases they could be right. For instance, what if the computer in the car has a malfunction? What would happen then? Or what if the car will not switch to manual drive? These are some of the more important questions that would need to be tested and thought about. Driver want to feel safe, but can the put their faith in a computer?

Driverless cars can have their plus sides to safety. Though, with the positives there will always be the negatives and the questions. Will the driverless car function right, or will there be mistakes? I believe that no matter how much they try, there will always be a problem with it, but the driverless car can be a safe way of transportation.",2
0b15a66,"My argument for the driverless cars would be against them. I feel like it would be alot that comes with having one of those cars. There are alot of things you would have to do and know in order to stay more cautious then a car you would normally drive yourself.The driverless could also be dangerous in the most simplest ways. There are also alot of things you have to watch out for. All easy ways to get out of somethings are not always the safest.

I feel as if alot would come with the cars because you have to really make sure you know what your doing and keep your eyes on the rode at all times although you should already do that. I also feel like parts for the car would be way more expensive considering it drives on its on. It will eventually become a headache to some who thought it would be easier to just hop in a car that goes on its on , not knowing everything that comes along with the car. Sometimes you have to think about what you really getting before you just hop in it and go. Thats why i said i feel like its alot to come with those cars.

When buying a car like that there are alot of things you need to understand. You will have to have patience and structure. I say that because even though it drives on its own it still needs a human hands on the wheel at certain points and times of the day. Even though the driverless car drives on its own most the time , a human still has to take over when coming upon a construction zone or coming upon a pedestrian maybe even alot of traffic. Its only so much a car can do automatically.

The car could be dangerous because by it not being able to go through certain things it can lead into yourself or somebody else getting hurt. It also can lead into somethings even getting damaged. When driving a automated car you have to be more catious then what you would be driving a regular car. Not all easy ways are the safest ways out of situations especially when dealing with a car. Cars can be a dangerous thing to choose , thats why when you do get a car you should choose wisely and make sure its good for future refferences.

So once again i am against driverless cars. I feel they are not say for people to just drive as an everyday car. I feel as if somebody get one it should only be used for fun in like an empty parking lot or brung out at night when there is really nothing going on. I only say that because not only do i want the person that has one to be safe i want everyone around them to be safe as well. So no driveless cars should not come.",3
0b1ab1d,Driverless cars may sound cool and less stressful but sound like they can put your life in alot of danger. Facebook twitter and social medias have troubles everyday so why dont you think your car would mess up and put you in danger from a little problem that its having. Driving on your own may be more safe than trusting technolgy to get you somewhere .Driving one of the driverless cars sounds like you can rest or just sit back and watch where you are going but what if you get in a crash and you didnt do anything the car did that might take alot of money out of your pockets for something you didnt even do. Cars that warn you when things are coming may be a good idea but what if one day they have a problem and dont tell you when something is coming and you run into someone money out of your own pockets once again to get car fixed and to fix the persons car you ran into. Cars that people control on their own may be the safest way to stay over the years until they get technology 100% right.,2
0b23a57,"I think that sometimes it would be good to use FACS, but at the same time, it would also be smart to not use it all the time. FACS is a Facial Action Coding System that detects the way someone is feeling. It can tell if you are feeling sad, happy, energetic or tired, just by your actions. I think we should only use it if we HAVE to, otherwise, just use our human instincts and look at each other to tell how one another is feeling.

I believe we should use FACS if it is a necessity. If someone is showing signs or actions that are just merely impossible to interpret, then yes, we should use FACS. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" says Dr. Huang. If someone is just smiling kind of broadly, like the article tells us, and not really showing us if they are smiling or not, I believe that is a time that we should use FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Some people though, think that we should not use it, and I agree with them just a little bit.

When should we not use it? I think times that we should not use it are when it is easy to tell the way someone is feeling, or if someone has a medical problem that would be affected by this. We also should not use this if you are at home. I know that in today's age, most homes probably don't have a PC that hooks into the wall anymore. Nowadays, most homes just have a laptop that everyone will share, and they will call it a home computer. Either that, or most people probably just have their own personal laptops. What I am trying to say though, is that we should not use it at home because as the article say, a home PC could not handle the complex algorithms that FACS requires.

Now, if you are one of those people who are somewhere in the middle, you don't know if we should use it or not, I would say just look at how it works. All FACS does, we as human can pretty much do ourselves. It just takes movements that you do, and then says what it thinks your emotion is that you are feeling. But, if you think about it, we can do that do as humans. So, there might be one reason that you start leaning more towards not using it. You might start to think again though if you think about what i said earlier. If someone is smiling broadly, we can't really tell how they are feeling. So, that might be a time that you would say use it.

Now, even after looking at all of this information, I will probably always be one of those people who just don't know if it would be good or not to use it. If you don't, then you would just use your human instincts and try to tell what someone is feeling. You might just be one of those people who likes to do everything old school. If you do, then that must mean you just don't want to try to tell what someone is feeling. This could be laziness, but who knows. Maybe that is a time that you should use FACS. ",4
0b271eb,"I think the use of technology to read emotions in a classroom is valuable to classrooms. Students can learn alot more when using the Facial Coding System. It can help them be aware of their own emotions, and can help them have more fun learning.

To start, it can help you have more fun by learning because it can detect your emotions and change up the lessons. In paragraph six, it says, ""...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Its saying it can be aware of how you are feeling about the lesson. Weither your bored, cunfused, etc. It can make it less confusing for you, and make it a little bit more enjoyable and easier for you to learn. Also, in the same paragraph it says, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" By either smiling or frowning it can go on the the next thing or ad that you would most likely enjoy. It can make waiting for what you are waiting for more enjoyable so you don't sit in boredom. For example, while waiting for an ad on youtube or any video you are watching that wont let you skip,or any game. It can detect your emotion and go on to a diferent ad the next time. That can make watching or seeing ads more fun then the last ad that had. Next, It can help you be aware of how you are feeling either happy or sad. In paragraph four it says, ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements"" By them tracking your movements, it can help not only them notice you are sad, happy, bored, or any of emotion you are feeling. It can also attract your attention too and helping you realize it. Your mouth is stretched sideways and uses the ""Zygomatic major"" while you fake a smile. If you pay attention, you can tell if you or others around you are smiling like that. It can help you be aware if they are faking their smile and happiness. It can also teach you a little bit of science, and you wouldn't know. Dr. Huang talks about about how the process begins, and how many muscles you have. The System can teach you how about all the emotions we have also.

I think the Facial Action System is a good idea for the classrooms. It can teach you a little bit about science. Also, about how to reconize yours and others emotions, and make learning and wiaitng more enjoyable for you. ",3
0b28ade,"Do you really believe the face on mars was made by an alien? Well my name is Sydney, and im a scientist here at NASA.Im here to tell you the truth about the ¨Face on Mars.¨ Lets begin by telling you the how the face on mars was discovered.

In 1976 ¨Vikings 1 spacecraft was snapping photos for possiable landing sites for Vikings spacecraft 2,when a human face appeared¨At first scientist like myself thought it was another Martian mesa,but something was different about this one. There was an odd ¨shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨

NASA took the image and unveiled it for the whole world to see. Once the world saw this image people went crazy over it. The ¨Face on Mars¨ was in ¨movies,magazines,radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stroe checkout lines.¨ But then people started taking it to far and coming up with there own ideas. People started to say it came from aliens,I know how crazy.

Some scientist at NASA even started to believe what the people were saying. Then NASA decided to go up to mars to get another picture of it 18 years later. They said it was important to taxpayers. ¨On April 5,1998, When Mars Global surveyor got over there his team snapped 10 pictures of the face.¨

When the pictured was taken it was ten times sharper than the Vikings picture. So when the picture appeared on the JPL website,it revealed a natural land form. So After all it was not an alien monument. But wait were not done yet. People were not satisfied because they said the picture was taken at the wrong angle and on a winter day which was cloudy.

Then on April 8,2001 on a summer day and no clouds,Mars Global Surveyor was close enough for a second look. With the teams camera they captured an extraortdinary photo. With this picture you can blow it up three times bigger to see what it really is. The team blew it up and showed it was a butte or mesa landform,most commonly found around the American West.

During all of this I have learned that what looks to be a face was actually a landform. The Face on Mars turned out to be neat because it got used in movies,and ect. It also led people imagineation to think that well maybe there was life on mars before us. So next time what you see can look like something, but turn into something way different. ",3
0b2a399,"I think that that the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of people is valuable. I think this because sometimes its important to know someones emotion, and if they are faking or lying. This technolgy could be helpful for people to indicate wheather they need help or not. I also think that tis technology could help save lives too. I'll explain why.

First reason on why this technology is valuble is because it can be used in the classroom to know wheather a student is confused on the lesson or not. A shy student sometimes wouldnt want to ask for help about the lesson. So using this technology for would be very useful because teachers would now know who and who needs help. It could also help teacher to know if a student is angry, sad, etc to know how to help them. That one reason why I think this techonolgy is useful.

Another reason why emotion reading technology is useful because in paragraph 8 the article stated "" to an expert, faces dont lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politcian or celebrity isnt being truthful"". This means now we could know if a leader is being real or not. It could help with votes during an election to choose the correct politician. Not only that but in genral to knoe if people are lying or not.

last reason why I think the use of this technology is valuable is because it can save peoples lives. using this technolgy would let you know how a person is feeling. If a person is depressed and on the edge of doing something that they shouldnt , using this emtion reading technology could alert people on how others can be feeling very down and thode people could help them. It could also help parents knowing wheather their child is happy or not and I think a parent should know their childrens emotion because half the time we dont express our selves to our parents. So thats why I think using technology that can indicate your emtion is valuable.",3
0b2bfc4,"This artical is about, FACS (Facial Action Coding System), which is a new software

that has been developed, it improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This computer software was made so a computer can detect your emotions to understand what you like and dont like. The author states that, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.""

I believe that we should use this process on computers at the schools, so that the computers better understand the schools students. The author states that, ""This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries."" This software can express many different emotions such as, happy, mad, sad, ect. It can also store infromation, as to what you like and what you dont like, by the way your muscles movwe in your face. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical infromation as electronic code."" It can also help a student if he/she is having trouble on the computer, it can do that by reading the emotions on your face by the way your facial muscles move in a certain way. The author states in paragraph 6 that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The author wrote the article, FACS (Facial Action Coding System), to help computers camunicate better with humans, by reading the way their muscles on their face move, or react, to express how humans feel. This new computer software would be a good thing to add to the schools computers, that way the computers can better communicate, and help, the students if they are confused or bored. Even if you have different face expressions, or mixed emotions. the auther says, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). Computers need to be able to better communicate with humans.",4
0b2c063,"The face on mars was made when the and on mars was made. Nobody can really say they know how the face got there. The reason why i say that is because nobody was there to make it or see who made it. No humans never lived there or was made there. NASA had sent out a Viking one spacecraft that was looking for a spot for the other Viking two to land. As the Viking was looking around it had saw somthing that look like a face and it took a picture of it and sent it to mission controllers. But the Viking one was not there when the face was first formed so NASA don't know how it got there or know how it was made.

NASA had never told nobody but the people that work there but after a coulple of days later they had showed the world what they had saw on mars. They had called it a ""huge rock formation that resembles a human head and mouth, eyes, and nose"". Some scientists belived that aliens made it and once lived on the planet mars at one time. All the people know is what they think or know what NASA told them how it got there. But really they dont know the date it was made, how it was made, what it was made with but all they know is what they got from a picture.

Know if some one frome earth was there and made it and was there to take picture's of them making it. It would have been a nother story then NASA can say that they know how it was made, what it was made with, what date it was made, and who made it. But they don't so they have to go off the picture that the Viking one took. They have to think how it was made, when it was made. ",2
0b35fa9,"First,The face NASA found in Mars is just a landform and I can prove it. On the picture on 1976 it actaully looked like a human face, but a human face cant be that big. On 1998 the eyes and mouth started fading away like it was disapearing. On 2001, you can't even see the face anymore.

Next, It looked like it cracked, also scientists 'figured it was just another Martian Mesa, comman enough around Cydonia.' But, also scientists believed the face was an alien artifact but, they can't prove that it is just what they believe.

Then,On April 5, 1998 it said that Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia to see if it was real. When they got there they took some pictures of it for JPL web site, but it revealed that it was just a natural landform and it wasn't a alien monument.

Finally , just to make sure on April 8, 2001 it said in the article that ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""""They rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. What the picture actaully shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landform common around the American West.

In conclusion, there was no alien or face in Mars. It was just a landform making it look like there was a human face. This is my essay telling it was just a landform.",2
0b3ab03,"I am for technology being able to read students emotions. It can really help in the classroom when kids are starting to feel like the lesson is getting kinda stale. In the text it states, ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This can help alot of kids or teens that have a hard time staying focused i the classrooms or become bored easeily, it that is to happen the computer will modify the lesson to make it more entertaining fo the student like any good teacher would be able to do.

It also have many uses outside the classroom. In the text it states, "" The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery. This technology can help animaters, surgeans , artist , and many other lines of work. We perform different facial expression every day and having a computer or maybe even a phone in the future that can ajust your device to the emotion your having at the time or throughout the day. This type of technolgy can change the world and make lifes easier in the classroom for students or regular jobs.

There are many positives about thing about this technologhy though there are a couble negatives. In the modern day home computer or phone would not be able to input the many algorithms that are needed fo this technology to work. Also If your not expressive an your emotions your combuter would not be able to detect your emotins and will not ajust. ",3
0b47a00,"Dear Senator,

After doing some background research on the theme of the electoral college, i have realized that this system is wrong and should be changed. Now you msy aks yourself why?. Here are my reasons on why to exterminate the electoral college. And my ideas on what is going to replace it.

What the electoral college does is basically a chain of votes. Meaning someone votes for someone and then that someone votes for another someone. This may seem confusing, and personally i think it is!. Why vote for a slate of electors when we could vote for the president. I mena is like skipping a step of the sequence(a very complex sequence)

dont you think its easier, faster, better and less confusing to just vote for the president. Every single citizen votes for who they want. thats why i propose an idea. this idea is easier, faster and better...

Mr/Ms Senator lets apply the election by popular vote system. its less confusing and less biased. For ex. if u want to vote for ""Tim Hart""for president, you just have to vote simple right; now using the other system you have to vote for the group of democtratic people that is voting for Tim Hart. And then hope that they didnt steal your vote, and they voted for another candidate. You see what im saying her. The system of popular election vote is way safer than the electoral college.

Also this system is more equal than the other, speaking of the problem of small states. Ex ""large states gets more attention form presidential candidates than a small state does""(4 big states, P 21 L 10). This shows that the electoral college system is unequal. Now in the other hand with our system , no matter small or large states, everyone will get the same attencion.

To conclude this essay the election by popular vote is clearly safer, faster, better and more equal than the electoral college, this is why i ask you if you could just think about the idea, and share the word with your collics and people you know

Thanks    ",3
0b488e9,"My postion is agaist Driverless cars. From the article they are reliable. The saftey sensors could not function properly due to all the movement on the wrong also with the changes of directions. A GPS may be capiable of this but the GPS is not also controling the car. A GPS is basicailly the same thing as a sensor they work very much the same. The name doesnt even soud safe ""A driverless car"" it soiunds like an idea without very much put thought into it. Only

three states dont make to it illegal just to test the Driverless Car. That tells us that they are dangerious from all of the possible outcomes.

The biggest reason to be agaist this product called ""The Driveless Car""

is because the human is not in control of the vehical at all times. Yes the car has motion seniors b ut there is a lot of activies and movement on the road. On e crash from another vehical and motion seniors can be unsure what to do and where to go. For example what will the motion senior do at a 4 way road. there are too many risks and danerious possiblities.

Other big factors that could effect the technology is weather, water, wifi, the brakes could be second too late before hitting an object. One the first Driveless Cars model is a BMW that can reach up to 25 Mph. Now a car going 10 mph can put someone in the hopstial. A BMW not totally controled by a human at 25 mph can seriously hurt someone. those add to the big number of dangerious possiblities.

Overall just testing this car is dangerious. We can only trust our phones to get the job done only 75% of the time. It would not be wise or ""Smart"" to trust some technoigly that is in the same boat to drive us around at 25 mph speeds. ",3

0b4df74,"Driverless cars are the future of the roads. They provide an easier way to get to and from different locations, and can help prevent deadly and dangerous accidents. With driverless vehicles, they would prevent wasting excess gas due to them being programmed to be economically efficient. It would also provide a less stressful enviroment for the passengers allowing them to not worry about getting lost due to the gps in the computer driven cars.

Driverless cars will help preserve the enviroment by not using excess gas. ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" A future with driverless public transportation would make the lives of people easier. Having driverless cars become a full on public-transport taxi systerm would help prevent the amount of non enviromentally friendly vehicles driven on a daily basis. Driverless cars with the use of sensors would prevent many car accidents and traffic situations if programmed correctly. ""Futher improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" There will be fewer traffic problems if driverless cars took over. There are companys working on improving how driverless cars handle traffic situations. ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Although driverless cars are not one hundred percent self driven, it is still good to allow the driver to take over when they want to or need to. WIth the addition to alerts and warnings telling the driver if the car needs to be manually controlled, it allows for a even safer enviroment. Once these ""smart"" cars have been proven safer, many states may soon open up to the use of the driverless car. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Caliornia, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have lead the country in allowing limited us of semi-autonomous cars; manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe.""

In conclusion driverless cars are the future of automobiles. The driverless cars provide a economic and enviromentally friendly aspect to the road. They will allow better traffic conditions and prevent more accidents. There will have to be certain laws that come into effect concerning driverless cars, but overall they would provide a safer, healthier enviroment for everyone. Once they have been proven as more reliably safe, driverless cars will begin to brighten the worlds future by bringing these positive aspects onto the road on a daily basis.",4
0b4ecc7,"There are positive and negative aspects of a driverless car. Some people might love the idea on the other hand other people might not. I believe driverless cars are the future, and there going to come up with some very smart cars in the near future.

I believe that driverles cars are a genius idea because you can do anything while the car is driving. Well of course not everything you don't want to be sleeping and the car crashes onto something because it doesn't detect it. Many people run late in the morning on there way to work or school or wherever they might go and maybe didn't have time for breakfest or didn't finish getting ready

I believe that you can do that stuff while the car is in motion. Even though you need a driver there in the car ""Tesla is going to release a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time"" which means you'll only be driving that ten percent which isn't alot. Yes I do believe the safety of one another is very important but I think the manufactures wouldn't release a car if they knew it wasn't capable of doing the things that the manufactures promised. I am all for driverless cars but safety is very important to me but just like the article says "" the road to truly autonomous cars stretches ahead of us, we grow to the destination every day"". ",2
0b53b04,"Driverless cars can be helpful and dangerous. But, I think driverless cars are found to be more dangerous than helpful. If a person that has a driverless car falls asleep because they are bored and do not have control of the car, it may harm them in many ways.

In my opinion you can't always rely on technology to do work for you. Computers can break down and have mishaps at any giving time. In the text it states "" Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe"". Having a car built off techonology wouldnt keep everyone safe. Technology can fail. The only way to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, is to have a human driving, that can steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves.

People can be in more danger because of the roads as well. Roads are not always so much secure and safe. Roads are bumpy and have holes in them that can cause accidents. In the article it say's ""all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This means the driver will need to be awoke and alert at all times, but if you're driving for about 5-6 hours how can you stay awake if you have a car that drives itself and all you have to do is nothing?.

Driverless cars are dangerous, useless, and a waiste of money. Why have a driverless car that still needs a driver?       ",3

0b5c44b,"Alien comics are the real deal?

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement.

Our everyday lives have been simplified from machines that have been designed to do our work for us. Something people use everyday are cars. So, is advancing cars the next step for improvement or will it be best kept as an idea?

Driverless cars has both pros and cons, but overall will do more harm than good. Car wrecks are very common and can happen to anyone. If we drive our cars by ourselves we feel as if we have more power or control over the car and its actions. A car designed to do the driving for you could be helpful in some ways, but would you want to put your all of your trust into a machine that has the power to take your life? Just like our cellphones and other everyday devices, they mess up. Failure in technology will always occur no matter how nice the product or idea might be. Although driverless cars will not fully be completly driverless. You still can have the ability to take over the driving, but then what is the point? People have been driving cars for years and years. It is better to not fix what is broken, than to adapt to a different lifesyle.

In conclusion, the future may be rising, but sometimes it is better to leave things the way they are. As time goes on, more advances will be added to cars to enchance the way we drive. Until then, a car needs its driver.",2
0b64865,"In ""The Challenge of Exploration Venus,"" the author did a really good job supporting her ideas. In the first paragraphed the author explained what Venus is and where it was located. And then they explained how Venus was the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, and distance, then they talked about how they didn'd sent send a human their at first (paragraph 5). They also talked about how NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and how ""peering from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate to dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"" (pargraph 6). NASA is also working on other appoaches to study Venus. For exanple, ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have benn tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions (paragraph 7). And the finnal thing they talked about was how ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itsself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidting endeavors (paragraph 8).

0b6df5c,"Emotions in the classroom? This is a question ask by many people. Should we or should we not include technology that can read our emotion in the classroom. I believe that we should because this could bring learn to a whole new level.

We all know that moment when a teacher is teaching something on the board and we pretty much have no idea what they are talking about, imagin a computer being able to reconize that and help you out with out the teacher having to stop the lesson. This would make the lives of students and teachers better, student that understand could go on with the lesson as the teacher teaches it. The students that don't understand could wait up for a second and learn that part of the lesson before they through another wrench at you.

This topic intersest many people because we have the ablity to change the way students loearn every day. I often wonder when my parents ask me what I learned today. Many days I come home without a clue on what I learned then i'm expected to do a homework page or two everynight. With the new technology we would'nt have to worry about students going home without a clue if because if could reconize if they were having a tuff time. then it would instantly jump into action to try to help the student.

This could also help students learn their intrests, here at my school we have a class called Careers. This class exposes us to many diffrent career choices, with this new technoloy this could help us decide if we like that career. The emotion detecer could really help when you are stuck between to jobs. It will tell you what you are feeling between the jobs.

The only issue with this is how could they make this famous around the globe. With technology where its at right now the invention could take years to put into a class room. How would they mass produce this peice of technolohg? This is a question I often find myself thinking about when I am told a new invention is coming out. Paragraph 7 really hits me hard with the question of, How do we need to wait until our home PC can handle it? This is something that the creators need to take into conideration if they want this exposed to the pubic.

I say yes to this technology joining the everyday classroom because I believe that so many kids would beafit from having anothe ""teacher"" in the class.                   ",3
0b700a7,"Would you want somthing that reads your emotions and finds out weather you are happy, sad or depressed. If so read more to find out some more information about this device to see if you would want this at your job or school.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

In conclustion, i belive that this device should be in schools all round that United States. My reasoning is when people come in the school that system can do backround checks on parents or adults that come into the buliding. That makes sure they keep the school safe for teachers and students in the process of everyone else in the building at that time. Plus they can have data that will be saved for when they know when that person can to the school and left the school.        ",2
0b708bc,"Venus is well known to be one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. The author believes that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It may appear that Venus is the scecond planet from sun, its so to call Earth's twin, but although Venus is the second hottest planet. In despite of the conditions Venus may be worthy of pursuit.

Such like Earth, Venus is the closest in terms of density and size. Venus is a challenginhg planet for humans to study. As the authors states ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land"", but unfortunately no spacecraft has survived. It is believe that long ago, ""...was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". The author may believe that Venus isn't a lost cost.

However, Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,and it is believe that the average temperature is over 800 degrees. Even though Mercury is clsoer to our sun, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. In these conditions Venus is a dangerous planet to study. Although the consequences the NASA has one idea to send humans to study Venus, ""...allow scientists to float above the fray"". The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. It may not be easy but are survivable for humans.

In conclusion Venus is an unstable planet to study, Venus may be worthy pursuit despite the dangers of the weather but it may possible to study it above the planet. The author also explains that NASA has a way to study the planet which may be useful but is it worth it?    ",3
0b72cc9,"I think that the author should further his study because of the things that they already predicted used to be on Venus and the things that are now there. They've said that Venus is a sister planet to Earth, so I think that it strongly is possible that there was life and lots of other thing on Venus. If there wasn't life there then they could've had the chance of having life there if Earth were to end.

In the passage it says ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"". Venus having things like that are the exact reason that Venus should be explored. Getting to Venus might be a tough thing though. This passage also states that ""no spacecraft the landing for more than a few hours."" So getting to Venus will be one dangeroud yet good trips to take.

While traveling to Venus could be very risky and dangerous imagine the experience you'll get. Traveling to Venus wouldn't be like going to Italy, it's a better chance to see something new. Scientist are actually speaking about visits to the planet in the future, because Venus is closer to the sun it'll be really hot there, so hopefully scientist can figure that out. That could possibly be a huge part of why no spacecraft has yet to land there.

So that people can go and explore Venus, NASA is working on new ways to go and study Venus. They're looking into old technology from World War ll. NASA says that our modern computers are a lot more delicate than computers from back in those times. So basically a mixture of the old technology from the 40's and modern day technology could possibly help us travel to Venus.

I do think that traveling to Venus would be a could be something new for us, we have lots of things to work on of course before setting off to Venus. If there are mountains and valley's and all other things like that, I think that's it's worth giving a shot.",3

0b8588b,"I'm wanting to keep the Electoral College because it comes in handy in our system for voting. They can help us break a tie between two competing candidates that want to become presidents of the United States. You may not think its a big deal but it is. I don't like the ""winner-take-all"" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. Now back on to the subject, the Electoral College can be important to the system. The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus.         ",1
0b869b2,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valueable. It can help actors learn how to make a smile or frown look real, it can help a teacher figure out if a student needs more help just by scanning his or her face, and it can help us figure out what our friends are realling feeling.

First, movies are a big part of our life. It is never fun to go to watch a movie and see that the actors arent good they either look like they dont know what they are doing or they try looking sad and actually look like the happest person on earth. with this technology like the arthour says "" Drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". This shows that even just practicing a fake smile for a movie or for when you are on stage could make the play seem better than it already would be of the actors didnt know how to put on a real smile.

Facial action coding system can also be helpful in the class room so when you have a kid on the computer you can see if they are strugging and they need more help or if they are powering through it and need a bit more of a obsticle to go through. like in in the article "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confussed or bored...it could then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could help a teacher out cause they cant always tell of a student is having trouble. they also dont always see the when they are doing their work at home. This is like the teachers second hand man when coming to helping students get the help or challenge they need.

Lastly, you may have a friend that you cant tell if they are sad or happy because . The article states "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"". You never if a friend is putting on a fake smile to keep you from getting down, but thats just hurting them even more so you sometimes have to do things yourself and get them the help they need.

In conclusion, I believe that being about to see someones emotion just by scanning their face could be very helpfull to get kids the help they need or the challenge, helping a friend get through a rough time, and making movies better. ",4
0b88519,"Do you ever wonder why the world is becoming so much warmer by the minute? Not many people stop and realize what's the real problem. Us humans are the major problem in this situation, we don't see that we are taking what we have to an advantage. To our factories, cars, or even trash. The main one that is causing our greenhouse gases to rise is our Power plants, but following behind the power plants are vehicles. Cars have become a major impact in our lives, from hurting one another, to hurting the place we live on. Car-free cities are going to help make a big, helpful change in peoples lives.

In the city of Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Vauban is called a ""car-free"" place, cars aren't allowed on the streets of vauban. Many people sold their cars to live in vauban, all around vauban wants a healthy way of living. Vauban allows car ownership, but the cars are only to be parked in two places which are the garages. ""When I had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter said. It is a much healthier and less stressful way of living, new ideas will always come in handy. The United States Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car Reduced"" communities. Hopefully they get someone to tag along with this promotion, and get supporters to enforce it.

Bogota, Colombia is going on their third straight year of a ""Car Free"" city. They are wanting to reduce smog, so buses and taxis are permitted. ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo claimed. There was a consequence to the ones who didn't follow the rules, which was a $25 fine that they had to pay each time. Eventually, Two other Cities in Colombia, Cali and Valledupar, latched on to the idea of a ""Car reduction."" You see many people walking, running, riding bikes or skateboarding. A lot of people like this new idea that people are going by,  it's an great way to step foward to save the earth and its problems.

Over time, Americans haven't been buying cars, driving less, and over years less people get their license. America is hitting its driving peak, The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and then decreased signifigantly since then. Not many can afford a brand new car, or the insurance, most people are unemployed and dont work at all. Cars have been around for a long time, but over that time period it has caused major life impacting issues. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said mimi sheller. Many people aren't aware of this ""Car Free"" idea, which is an disadvantage.  If this idea was spread through televison, newspapers, or even social media many people will pick it up and take it into consideration.

In an overall sum up, it is better to live ""Car Free."" You wouldn't have to stress yourself out about gas prices, fixing your cars, or your world becoming a big ball of heat. If Transportation and power plants are the two major impacts in our lives, we need to knock one out. Until, we can get some second options on power plants our best choice is to forbid cars. We have many other options to get around our city, running, walking, riding bikes or etc. The ""Car Free"" idea is very creative, not many people would take inisuative to help make the world a better and safer place. With an exception of a few, buses and taxis will be there for long distance trips. Cars caused a huge impact on our lives, but hurting us and our home which we call earth. The business plan is ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey.""

Cars aren't always there to help us, life is all about choices, it's time to make yours.    ",4
0b8e735,"You might have heard about the face on Mars but is it really a face imprint? I think it is not anything to worry about you see natural things on earth like plants that resemble faces at times. Are the plants a sign of aliens too? Of course not, it is natural to see something like this. It would be silly to think that food or a landscape on earth is an alien.

Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Once he got the pictures back it reaveled that it was an actual natural landform. We even went back on April 8,2001 to take another photo with a camera that had absolute maximum resolution. The picture had came back equivilant of a butte or mesa-landforms commonly found in the American West.

This is just from my point of veiw so I would kindly recommend you do your own research. You might change your mind you might not and thats okay.

Not everybody agrees on everything. I just hope you take my evidence into consideration.        ",2
0b8ed23,"In today's world our environment is not as healthy as it was year's ago. There are many green house gases disturbing our atmosphere and our ozone layer. One of the main reasons this is happening is due to motor vehicals. Car's, trucks', motorbike's, gasoline powred or diesal powerd, they all hurt our environment. There are some place's that are trying to stop the gases from hurting us and it is helping.

Owning a car is an important way of transportation. It allows us to get from point A to point B in time's that would be much slower if we did not have a car. Yet car's and truck's can sometimes be hurtful. Owning a car can be cost effective, you must pay for the fuel that is hurting the atmosphere, if it breaks down you must pay for expensive parts and service. Even if you have the money and the time to own a car, you are realy still hurting the environment by burning fosil fuels and causing green house gases.

In some place's in the wrold they are reducing car usage. They are having national days where if you use your motor vehical you are to be charged by ticket for some money. In paris there was a week of regulated driving to reduce smog emision. On several day's of the week car's with even numbers on their tag were not able to drive. The next day the odd number did the same, if caught using a motor vehical you would be fined 22£ ($31). People were outraged and some were so angered they didn't like he law and got thier vehical impounded. That is how Paris did their part in helping the atmosphere.

In Bogota, Colombia they had a similar ocasion, but only for one day of the year. They have done the same thing on that specific day for the past 3 years, they too have been charged with tickets for $25 if found using a motor vehical. They also had this day in two other citys in Colombia, Cali, and Valledupar joined in on the fun of helping the environment.

In the U.S President Barack Obama has had goal's to also reduce emision's of motor vehicals. The United State's being one of the main counrty's in car production see's owning a car a culture, they see driving, working on your own car, and racing as a way of life. But some american's have had enough of trafic jam's, stressed out lives in a jam packed city full of car's and truck's causing green house gases. They have reduced the miles driven since 2013, and a good amount of people don't even want to have a license. In crowded city like New York they have started a new bike sharing program, their tolls for bridges and tunnels have skyrocketed. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. This means people are getting more involved in helping the environment and reducing hurtful gases that hurt our ozone and our atmosphere.    ",3
0b8fea3,"Many companys out there are striving for driverless cars. It's an innovation that has been predicted for decades. There is, however, some problems that can occur with the automated car. Most people would think of this as an argument of if A.I. should drive, or if humans should, but I believe it's more like an argument between the human error or the limited thought capacity of a computer.

The thought of automated control has been thrown around in many subjects such as border control turrets to androids. It's also been a popular science fiction subject for movies like The Matrix and iRobot. In both of those movies, the A.I. takes control over humanity. If certain disasters were to happen, the A.I. wouldn't know what to do while a human could.

On the other hand, the automated car could save lifes. Many people each year die in car crashes, and alot of those crashes are drunk/distracted drivers. In an automated car, the human could be drunk and the car's performance wouldn't be affected. If only the human couldn't drive the car, nobody would be able to speed, or get in car chases. Car related deaths would go down for sure.

In the end, automated cars is almost a certainty for the future. Humanity always strives to be more adavanced. A case can be made for both sides on if it's the right way to go, but automated car just makes a stronger case. If a car can be made to react to certain problems, the automated car will be a hit. I guess you just can't hold back innovation.     ",3
0b9274e,"The world has become extremly evolved and is now able to create software that can read every single emotion on a person's face. It can be used in several different situations. From the text, the author talked about how it is used to read emotion in paintings and also read emotions of students. This emotion reading technology would be a good addition to the classroom because it could help to make sure kids are more engaged in the lessons.

Today, school can feel long and tiring. If we had emotion reading technology in schools, it would help to engage students more in the lessons. The author explained how if a student begins to show boredom during a lesson, it would be able to change it in a way to please the student. If that was added to schools, students would be able to focus more since the lesson is being tailored to that specific student. Not only will it recognize when a student is bored, but also confused. If a student gets confused during a lesson, the computer can help by reapeating that part of the lesson. In a normal classroom with a teacher, you would have to stay after class to be able to get more explanation of the lesson. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" What he means by this is that people don't express their emotions by telling them to others. We don't share how we feel. We simply try to express it on our faces. A teacher wouldn't tailor the lesson to each and every person's emotion based on their facial expression. It would be impossible to tailor the lesson to a classroom of 25 students and their needs. Each student in the classroom has a different mind set. Some are able to concentrate well and pass with straight As. Others are unable to concentrate and will only pass with a C. With this new technology, we would be able to tailor the lessons so that each student is able to pass with good grades.

The technology to read facial expressions of emotion would be helpful in the classroom to help students focus more and understand their school work more. If you stop paying attention for just a second, you'll be lost for the majority of the lesson. When there is technology to read your emotions, it'll be able to understand when it needs to modify the lesson to suit the student's needs. ",3
0b9d88d,"Driverless cars are cars with an automated driving system. Cool right? Using binary code, sensors and even 3-D imaging to check surroundings. Sounds futuristic like something from Back to The Future or Star Trek. But what good could they really do in society. Driverless cars are coming but should they? Society today can do better without technology controlling even more of our lives and something so vital as cars.

Google has gotten a head start on this process of driverless cars. The article states the car can ""read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code."" Yes the car is smarter than the average human being, that's because it's a computer. A computer cannot make judgement calls like a human being. With the intent on not crashing a driverless car could make mistakes and not know that they are mistakes. Such as hitting a child in order to avoid crashing into a tree. Something this article did not touch on was that the Google self driving car had its first accident last week when it hit the side of a bus in Northern California.

Today we have sensors and cameras in our cars but the driver maintains the speed, directions and trajectory of the car and where it goes. Humans must remain alert at all times, as stated in this article. Even though with self driving cars there is no human error involved consequences could emerge from there being to many of these types of automobiles on the road at once.

If this car goes into mass production problems will emerge just like with every other car brand. We have today many tools to assist our cars in knowing when to stop, turn and check coolant and power steering levels. We are still in control. In the article isn't was stated that if a problem should arise ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" What if this function doesn't work? Should the driver always have to hands on the wheel or would that ruin the point of this driverless car.

Is society ready for this or is this years in the making and we are just getting ahead of ourselves. Either way self driving cars should not be allowed on the street without a driver until the technology is 100% proven error free. This could take some time but it's worth it. This will significantly limit the cost of lives that could come from unnecessary laziness caused by this driverless car. Human error will always be a problem but human judgment will by far outweigh the intelligence of automated systems. ",5

She was a subject of Leonardo da Vinci Renaissance paniting Mona Lisa was the one that can recongize emotions she was the one that can demonstrat and bring a smile to your face so bascially she was just like a computer in way. Dr Huang was a smart person in the facial expressions he was the one that was trying to found out things about the human communication for technolgoly.

Imagine if you was looking in the mirror and you suggest an emotion can your lab partner recongize your emotion. I would say you could but it all depends because you can't really tell because he can have a face emotion that you see him with everyday that don't mean that he happy it can mean that he mad or sad or tired.

Driverless cars will be very useful because the people of our country are getting more lazy as time goes by. There are many benefits and many concerns when it comes to driveless cars. Driverless cars should be used in the near future because they are benefical by their technology used, sensors, and functions.

The technology used for the driverless cars are very beneficial compared to an average car. When the article states, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This quote shows that the technology used for the driverless cars are very beneficial and above an average car. With the driverless car having sensors it can mimic the skill of a human at wheel which is a amazing.

Sensors are not new in technology. The sensors used for the driverless car are one of its many benefits. The article says, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" This quote shows that the use of sensors is more safer and leads to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

The driverless car's functions are out of this world. The driverless car for the most part can work well indepently, but may need the drivers help in certain situations. The article states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notfiy the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This shows that driverless cars have very important and benefical functions, but may need the drivers help in certain circumstances.

Driverless cars will be very benefical in the near future. There is a lot of debate between the driverless cars as to whether they should be used or not in the near future. The driverless car has its many pros and cons. The driverless car has many special qualities and should be improved to be used in the future. The driverless cars should be used because of their technology used, sensors, and functions.     ",4
0ba4fc3,"I think the face reading software would be good for educational purposes. I don't think that using the face reading software would be good for places everywhere, though. The software could help teachers with what they should be teaching and with how they need to plan their lessons. The face reading software could help students express their emotions and feelings to their teachers. Overall I think that the face reading software would benefit the learning environment, because it would benefit teachers and students.

Using the software in the classroom could help teachers keep things exciting and interesting for their students. In paragraph 6, from the excerpt, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The software could help a teacher learn about what the students are interested in and what they don't understand, and need more work on. I don't think the technology should spread to everywhere in the world, such as to airports. If the machine misreads a face it could send the wrong kind of impression to those working at the airport. If places use the technology, they should also keep their basic security. The face reading technology could keep the learning environment more interesting and more up to date.

In conclusion, the face reading technology could and would benefit our learning environment everywhere. The technology would help teachers improve on their teaching techniques and lessons. I think it would help benefit kids that don't like to openly express their emotions with their teachers. The technology should be used wisely and should be well planned and processed.

0ba78ec,"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.

Out of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.

To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        ",3

If you exactly how someone felt then you would what to say and what not to say at a centain time. The person might be having a horrible day and you can say something that might make the even more made the they already are, and they could by chance of going off on you.

0bb0bc1,"Transportation is a must in today's society, and car usage plays a big role in the subject. Limiting car usage has many advantages. Reduced usage of cars can help the enviroment in various ways. Less car usage can help citizens be less dependent on cars, and can be a great stress reliever for others.

The enviroment is a big part of the lives of people and needs to be taken care of. Cars are known for polluting the air and damaging the enviroment. One of the problems about the air pollution involves greenhouse gas emissions. In the article (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal), Paragraph 5 states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Smog is another issue due to car usage. Paris is a known city for smog. In the article (""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer), it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."", meaning that smog is a big problem in the enviroment. Air pollution can be reduced with limited car usage and can help the enviroment in which we live in. Being independent can be one of the many benefits of limited car usage.

Relying on car usage can put people at a disadvantage. Limiting car usage can help citizens become less reliant on automobiles. Paragraph 20 states ""BOGOTA,Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3, Andrew Selsky). There are many differents ways of using transportation without having to rely on car usage. Jobs and businesses can be accessible through many alternative choices of transportation. Source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states ""He and I have similar obsercations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk of take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" (paragraph 39). Different Transportaion routes, or options, gives a wider variety of getting somewhere. Limited car usage can help citizens be more independent with transportation. Limited Car usage can be a way of relieving stress.

Citizens believe that limited car usage gives them the advantage of relieving stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1, Paragraph 3). Reduced car usage can cause a fellow citizen to feel happier. Paragraph 35 of Source 4 says ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Citizens feel more connected with friends without the neccessity of car usage. Less Driving impacts the lives of citizens in a postive way.

Limited car usage can only be seen as an advantage, it brings out many positive things. Reduced Car usage is Enviroment friendly and reduces air pollution. Less driving is a better way of being independent and stress-free. The world can be a better place with limited use of automobiles.    ",4
0bb2665,"Look Technology is great and all but it cant be used for everything somethings machines dont understand like us.

For instance you could be like faking being depressed for a joke and then switch to being have in less than a second. And I dont believe that machines are capable of understanding our own communication.

Only because we have so many different ways that we communicate to one another.

""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?""

That quote from the story almost explains why that would be a big problem for the computers.

But trust me computers would be very valuable in classrooms on the positive side but on the negative side it just gives another thing to go wrong in a classroom.

I mean don't we already have enough technology in classrooms to helps us out and distract us.

Plus what if the scaner just decided to start malfunctioning and get the wrong facial scans then you could be feeling one way, but the computer could say another.

And who says that a computer tells you how you feel only you and you only knows how you really feel.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.""

What this quote does to theargument is it sort of shows that it would be extremely hard for the computer to know how each and every single persons own facial movements.

And a computer probably cant tell you how your feeling even though you might not even know yourself how you feel.

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his or her face.""

This quote from the story also shows that humans can figure out faster that a computer how someone is feeling even if they are have mixed feelings.

But we also have the ablility over a computer to be able to communicate to one another about our own emotions.

The bottom line is that you cant program every single human emotion into on single computer no a million computers.

Becasue not everyone is always feeling one emotion inside at all times.

We humans feel mutiple emotions at all times.

For instance you get and a on a test that you really might have need to pass and you start to cry but they arent tears of sadness they are tears of joy.

And a computer will see the tears and say that this perons is sad when really that person is so overwhelmed by happiness that they cried tears of joy.",3

While taking these pictures, Viking 1 snapped an image of what looked to be a human face on a region of Mars called Cydonia. Since then, two other photos have been taken by Viking 1 in the years 1998 and 2001.

Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa but what made them a little uneasy about that soulution was the face that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The head was around 2 miles long from end to end and was formed by shadows that gave off the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Because of the human-like features that appeared in the photos, people began to believe that the ""face"" was hard evidence that there was some kind of human life on Mars. Due to the fact that some scientist believed that the face was an alien artifact and the picture was the topic of discussion in places all around the world, scientist had to work even harder to find out what the photograph actually showed.

NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

0bbbed5,"Do you believe in aliens? I mean, do you honestly think that aliens are roaming around in our solar system? Some say yes, some say no. Do you believe that aliens created the Face of Mars? Let me tell you, they didn't. Aliens are not here & they didn't create this Face on Mars. Plenty of research is found to back it up too.

First, research has been concluded & done to prove that this is a natrual landform. In an article called 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' it states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web sit, revealing...a natrual landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Websites aren't enough for some people though.

Next, this face on mars simulates some landforms on Earth. Therefore, it would be a natrual cause that happened. It states in the article of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""What the picture actually shws is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.' says Gravin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" By reading this, it is making it clear that this landform is somewhat common. It stated that landforms such as the Face on Mars is common around the American West. If it can happen on Earth, why can't it happen in outer space?

On the other side, the ""Face on Mars"" has attracted a lot of attention, especially in the social world. It states in the article of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""The 'Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood Film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" People seem to think that they can believe everything they hear & see on television or on magazines or even in movies. Presenting us all with fake gossip & fake news is how these businesses get money. They know, one person will believe it, leading to thousands more. We tend to believe in the 'juicy' filled drama. Not everything you hear out in the world is true. I know, I'd rather believe real scientist, than businesses thirsty for money.

In conclusion, evidence from scientist (like me) from NASA is much for believable than Hollywood movies & headline magazines. There are no aliens. The Face of Mars just so happens to be a natrual landform.         ",4
0bc0443,"Cars, some people think they are the most important things ever made. In some places like Colombia they barley ever use them. Some people in Colombia even say that their everyday life is maybe even easier. People actually do get more easilystressed by just owning a car. With all this evidence given it is clear that limiting cars would be an advantage.

Cars are in fact a big disadvantage. In source one it even goes into detail about how much money it is to just to be a car-owner. In Freiburg, Vauban's streets there are ""car-free""  car-owners spend $40,00 along with a home to have space for their cars. As results to this 70 perecent of people in Vauban are not car-owners and 57 percent sold their cars. In source one it also says that the United States previous bills were 80 percent alone have gone to the highways and another 20  percent to transport. In source two and three Paris and Colombia were having to pay for fines of $25 to $31.

As another result to all the money people are playing just to be a car-owner people get very stressed over all of this. In source three Colombia banned cars with the exception of buses and taxis. After three years of banned cars people hiked, biked, skater, took the bus or took a taxi. With the three years and still in progress people in Colombia soon began to relise that ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza a local buisness man in Colombia.

Of course no one could buy any cars or stress over them if we can't breath. Cars do hurt our enviroment and green houses. By the gas and pollution we put into the world by just driving our cars around isnt any safter as if we got into a car crash. Everytime we drive cars or take the bus we just hurt our planet, plants, and people a little more and more. Just by this fact alone people should know that driing cars around everywhere is a giant disadvantage.

It would be an advantage to limit car usage because cars make everyone pay large amounts of money just to be called a car-owner. From spending all this money and being fined over stuff people do believe isn't fair most people in fact do stress themself out over this which is not healthy for anyone. Another fact abput limiting cars is that it would indeed improve our saftey not one for us people but for our enviroement too.             ",3

The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for who you would like to win, you are voting for an elector who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for who we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there has also been a few fiascos.

This style of voting has been going on since the beggining, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electors; they are not reliable. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This right here proves that the electors don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electors anyways? ""Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" We don't even get to select our electors, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for who we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.

The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabatoge the election. What is stopping more poeple from this? Some electors refused to vote for who they said they would. ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who ""validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so 'without establishing a precedent.'""

Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.

In conclusion, more people are aginst the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Less people would have a problem with the election process and it would go a lot smoother.

Thank you for your time,

0bc541d,"Being able to have a car that drives itself would be cool, right? Well, maybe not as cool as you think. Having a car that drives itself comes with many complications. These complications may include lack of safety, lack of total automatic driving, and lack of laws needed to operate a smart car.

The smart car is a nice invention, but with the lack of safety it isn't very smart to drive. The systems within the smart car may fail and cause the operator to be injured. Having the systems fail is the worst thing that could happen while driving a smart car. It may cause an accident if the smart car is not at it best quality. This lack of safety really worries me as a driver myself.

While the smart car appears to be able to drive without a driver, it can't. The smart car can operate on its own but it requires the operator to be fully alerted at all times because the car cant drive itself through certain situations. These include accidents and work zones, which would require the driver to take the wheel and drive through these situations. The driver would become bored while not driving and may even fall asleep do to the lack of action. It just seems way to dangerous to trust an ""automatic"", driverless car that isn't fully automatic nor driverless with my life.

Many states now don't even allow many smart cars to be driven. In order for these cars to be able to be on the streets many laws would need to be made or changed. Without laws just for these smart cars people would drive reckless. If no laws are put in place who will be held responsible for the failing of the systems in a smart car? "" New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident "". Laws are needed to drve these cars no matter the argument to keep us and those around us safe.

Do smart cars still seem cool? I'll leave that answer up to you, but take everything i have said into consideration. Smart cars may be the future, but the way they are now is too dangerous. There are too many complications including lack of safety, lack of automatic driving, and lack of laws needed to operate a smart car. So, is a smart car really smart?     ",4
0bcac40,"In the article ""The challenge of exploring venus"" The author does a great job of supporting the idea. I think anyone who is adventuruse and likes to learn about space would agree with the author. Such as my self, I like learning about our facinating solar system as well. How ever there are some pros and cons of exploring venus. Theres alot of factoring that goes into something like exploring another planet. You need to plan for everything and make sure yor ready.

In the artile the author does a fantastic job of convincing the reader to believe that exploring venus is a good idea. He also states that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on venus, This makes the reader want the integrity to do it even more. He also states the harsh conditions of venus and how no human could survive on venus. But yet comes up with a solution of how we can still go to venus wthout dieing. He purposes that you could use a ""blimp like"" plane to fly 30-40 miles above vensus and the tempuratres are bareable. However he doesnt propose whos funding it, how much it cost, or when this will take place. These things could lead the readr in a different direction when reading this.

By now im pretty sure you have a good understanding of what the author was trying to get across. You may ask why would people still want to explore in such harsh conditions, but the author does a great got of stating reasons why people such as astronoust still explore these harsh places. This gives good opportunity to discover something new and be credited for it. You never k ow you could be the next. ",3
0be5034,"The author tells the reader how Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because no ones been on the planet and metal would just liquefy so we can't send nothing nor no one up to Venus. But I think that the the author would like to know how it's like up there besides knowinf that it's hot, and maybe would like to know what we could do up there in those types of conditions.

Like many other planet most people would say we can't live in those types of conditions but scintist found out we could live on some planets and also grow food on some of those planets. So the author might think that it's worth finding out that if we could at least grow plants there since some plants can suvive and grow in real hot conditions.

Another posible reason why the author might would want to see if there is living life on Venus. Lots of people talk about there being more then just people on one planet so there could be some form of life on another. If we could grow food on some plants that could also mean that there's life on that planet too. So even thought it's extremelly hot on Venus doesn't mean that there isn't a form of living life on there.",2
0bea5df,"In the article "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author talks about how drivers cars may be in the future and the good and bad aspects of driverless cars.Some bad aspects of driverless cars are that some of the drivers of the driverless cars may get bored of sitting and waiting for their turn to drive. Also that antilockbrakes and drivers still seem to be a long way from the dream of calling drivers to take us wherever we may desire to go.

The drivers of the driverless car may get bored sitting and waiting for their turn to drive because there wouldnt even be a point in needing a driver if u have to sit and wait for your turn to drive. In the article it states "" The psychlogical aspects of automation are really a challenge, admits Dr. Werner Huber a BMW Project Manager Driver. Also what if the driver gets so bored from sitting around and waiting for his or her turn to drive and ends up getting into a car crash.

"" Antilock brakes and drivers assitance still seem a long way from the dream of calling drivers cab to take us wherever we desire.""

For example in the article it states that "" radar was a device on a hiltop cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack , So how driverless will these cars be in the near future?"" Futhermore can you imagine how much the driverless cars will be that can only cause more problems for not only everyone in the society that would like the car but also the manufactures of the car that may not make that much money because of how the expensive the cars may be.

In conclusion I beliveve that there are good and bad aspects of the driverless cars. Driverless cars can be a cool and unique part of the future that can also be hlepful. But

the price range of the car mey be very hgh. Also how bored the driver may be sitting and waiting for there turn to drive. So not only in my opinoin but also in tour opinion how driverless you think these cars my maybe in the future?    ",2
0beb053,"The positive of driverless is the car can be use until it crash or the owner doesn't wanna to use it anymore. The negative of driverless car are accident, and broke down middle of the road.

I agreed with the systems that they put on GPS receiver because many people that are using car have got lost in many places

or

get into an accident, and does people could get

help if they have that on their car. The danger about driverless more advanced to detect and respond the danger out of control skids or rolloevers.

The good thing about driverless are inidividual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in computer software to help driver safer and also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving task on their own.

I don't agreed with the driverless some

people won't notify the danger until they really see or get into one. I don't think it a good thing that people can drive and text at the same because they won't

don't be able to control the wheel and it could end up with a big accident. I don't agreed with the automakers about who fault if the car and the owner was in accident, I think both have a problem with their own or the car was not working because the wheel couldn't turn and boom it crashed.

In the conclusion, I think it bad and good at the same time but the car could help people get to places where they wanna go without walking. The bad it people could get in a big accident or broke down in the middle of road.         ",3
0bebdc5,"Driverless cars are coming out really close to use! I think they will be a really good advantege because they can be helpful for disabled people, they can help get around serority(old) people and a really good advantege for people that hate driving during the night part of the day and even for long trips. I wouldn't consider myself as a person agenst or with the driveless cars, because in my point there are good and bad things about these cars. Would you trust a driveless car to drive you around?

Places like Florida, Nevada, California, and direct columbia have let people drive these cars around there city because they believe that they would be able to work and would like to be know for were the car was used at.

Acorrding to the book it says that ""The law belives that more states will follow as soon as the cars are aproved and safe."" Automakers are continuing on fixing the problem that are willing to be solved be for they are aproved. The BMW company has tried to make a driveless car but can out different from what they expected.

The driveless cars are not that bad, i mean the help you drive around. They icluded a GPS, a Dubbed LIDAR for a 3-D car surrounding. The have also reduced the engine power and applyed brakes on the individual wheel which allows better respones and contral then a human diver could. The BMW company made a car close being to the driveless car, the car can function up to 25mph but has a sersor made to make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact the car can steer, it can accelerate and brake by its self but it is also desigined to navigate the road ahead to tell the driver when it requires human skilld, it will navigate working zones and even accidents. So most of these cars still requiere human skills and are not ready yet have earned the driveless car name.

Some cars have considered using carmeras to watch that the drive is focued on the road. The GM has requested vibrating seat's for the driver, which could be a bad idea to put in a driveless car that they dont even know if it is ready to work on it's own without kill or having someone injurd yet. Most of the thing included to the cars can be displayed but something not avalible to the drive is texting will drive that is a system featured of the safty.

Driveless cars sound like a fun thing to try out but we'll never find out if its really safe to use, even when they announce it and say it is. I still think there is a good side and a bad side to it because the only word to know about something and to test it is if its same for us to trust. Most companys like Nissan, Mercedes, Benz, Audi have said that they would have a car that can drives themselves by 2020, but i would belive that Mercedes would have a driveless car ready by 2020, but would behard to belive in right? We just have to wait and find about till car companys have more progress and information for us about the cars, which i hope soon because i would really like to try out this drivelss car, wouldn't you like to try it out?",3
0bee92d,"Dear Senator, the election is coming up soon and so is voting. The Electoral College and the popular vote get to select the president of the United States every year. I want this year to be a little different. This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president. The Electoral College knows all about thinking if the president is good enough for the country, and if he can be a good role model, or also a commander in chief. That is the reason why I would like to keep the Electoral College.

I would like the country to keep the Electoral College because they make good desiciosns, know if the candidate person is the right president, and last but not least they might think if the citizens would like this president based on his promises that he would like to keep. For example there are two candidates fighting to be president and it's time to vote and the Electoral College might look over  to see if the president looks like he can keep his promise to keep the coutnry safe, to make this a better country or not . That's what they look for in a president. That's the reason wwhy we should keep the Electoral College.

When the citizens want to vote for the president as well, they think of the same thing, if he's good enough for our country, and if he is going to keep us safe. The Electoral College knows a lot about picking the right president and they've been doing it for a long time.

""The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a  majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. That's enough electors to vote wether or not the president should be this person or that person.                              ",2

I'm in favor of the Electroral college because ""the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense"". There are five reason's im in favor of the electrocal college, One reason is the certainty of the outcome you wont win if you have more popular votes but less electoral vote ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"".

The second reason is Everyone's President ""The electroral College  requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

In the 2012 elections Romney was popular in the south ""no incentive to campaign heavily in those states."" He doesnt have to have to campaign that much in the south because he knows those states will vote for him. The third reason is the Swing States ""The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012-to focustheir campaing efforts on the toss-up state."" Voters in the toss-up states have to pay close attention to the campaign because they're the ones that are going to decide the election . The forth reason is Big states, the bigger the states the more electoral votes they have and the presidential candidates pay more attention to those states ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in campaign than a small state does...""

The fifth Reason is Avoid Run-Off Elections ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..."" that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents.

0bf39e6,"The electoral college is a process established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president & vice president, & the counting of electoral votes by congress. Their are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of impressive democratic origin & history; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. Our country would be much better off if we kept the electoral college, rather than choosing the president just based on the popular vote.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of choosing a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college methodis not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate, youre actually voting for a slate of electors.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled alottment of electors equals the number of its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for each senator. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected & what their responsibilities are.

The electoral college is good because it resores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in constitution. The elctoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Votes in the toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for each party's nominee... however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national populr vote. Yet that has happened in 2000, when gorge had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no intention or hope of carrying their state- democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thn they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible american population did vote in 2012's election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an entire election.    ",3

0bfeec7,"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversable but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethura of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeveors.

To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will acumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumilative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says ""Green house gas emitions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emitions in the country."" America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas emitions to start with but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations  and some smart city planning. The benifits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.

Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. instead you can lesiurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now."" This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant ""where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown{ed} out the occasional distant motor."" This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would dissagre with such an environment.

These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogata -The capital of Columbia, they actually organize ""Car free days"" seven million people in Bogota alone participated in the event, violaters would even have to pay a $25 fine. According to Andrew Selsky, the author of Car Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogoto, ""[Even] the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration and it has great effects on the environment.

In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues. If people stay on track it will be easy, fun, relaxing and the Earth will be admired for many years to come.                                                             ",4
0c02064,"In movies and televison, driverless cars have been featured as an invetntion for the distant future. Automakers have begun to attempt the creation of driverless cars. There have been creations close to the driverless car but not exactly what people have been wanting to create. Driverless cars are a pointless invention idea and should not be developed any further.

Companies should not continue to pursue the driverless car idea any longer. Google has tried since 2009 to make driverless cars and they have been close to making one. The cars that Google has made can, ""drive moe than half a milion miles wothout a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't fully driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"". The cars are not fully dirverless if they have to alert the driver to take over driving for a while through traffic. The driverless car should be independent and not need help from the driver on issues like traffic and pulling in and out of driveways. In 2013, BMW created a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" but not a driverless car, which is the goal not a car that can only help with traffic. Smart cars have lots of sensors that can help guide divers through difficult jams or passage ways but those sensors cannot function without some help from the driver. The smart cars made by BMW, ""steer, accelerate, and breake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" . Their cars are close to the function of a driverless car but still need more work to be done in order to be able to drive without humans. Since the cars today still have not been developed like the driverless car it is pointless to continue to try. Even though driverless cars can be helpful there are laws that prevent some people from driving them. It is proven that, ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars"" . Most states will not allow the testing of let alone the driving of driverless cars. If driving one of those cars is not even allowed, then what is the point of developing the project further? The driverless cars should not be created since barely anyone is allowed to use them. Even if there was a change in traffic laws, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"". There need to be new laws covering the case of an accident about whether the blame is on the driver or the manufacturer. These new laws that would be set will take up time and could cause lawsuits. The technology in the car could fail and the someone could be injured and there would be the question of who is at fault. If someones safety is at stake then the car should not be made at all.

The idea of making a driverless car should not be continued. The car is a pointless idea that does not seem to actually work and would fail. There have already been multiple attempts at making this car and all have come close but failed. The project should be ended and automakers should stop wasting their time on this car and focus on the other cars they make. ",4
0c0463c,"Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents. The author certainly proves their idea on why they think studying the planet Venus is worth it. The author supports their idea by making sure to back it up with evidence. In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports their idea well by explaining Venus's relationship with Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the power human curiosity can have. The author's use of evidence shows readers how seriously they took what they were writing. All the points they made were backed up by evidence on why they felt that way. The author made sure to clearly support each and every point made in their writing.

First, the author uses Venus's relationship to our own planet, Earth, to support their ideas. For instance, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (4). The excerpt above illistrates some of the similar features Venus has to Earth. The author uses the similarities of the planets to support their idea of venus being a worthy pursuit. The text also states, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (4). The author uses this sentence to support their idea by explaining how Venus is one of the nearest options to Earth for space travel. Saving travel time is one way Venus shows it is a worthy pursuit. Overall, the author uses the relationship the planets Earth and Venus have with eachother to support their thoughts.

Secondly, the author uses the point of human curiosity to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. To illistrate, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.

Additionally, the author uses evidence about how landing on Venus is possible to support their idea that it is a worthy pursuit. For example, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). The author uses this piece of evidence to demonstrate that Venus's conditions are possible for humans to survive, making Venus a serious contendor for space exploration. The author also states, ""Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible.

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" demonstrates how despite the dangers Venus presents, it is worthy of pursuing. Exploring venus seems like it is almost impossible with all the risks it offers, but the author makes it clear in this article that they disagree. Their use of evidence in their writing to support their belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how well researched their case is. The author used evidence on Venus's relationship to Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the natural curiosity humans have to support their idea. After taking a look at this article, readers know that the points made in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" were very nicely supported. The author's support made their idea a thought provoking case.",5
0c047cd,"The story is called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus "" This story is about trying to explore Venus even though it could be risky people are still curious on what Venus looks today.

Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it could be dangerous.The danger's of it would be that spacecrafts couldn't land on the surface without it melting.Venus also has a lot of eathquakes,and has a tempture of 800 degrees fahrenheit.Even though all these dangers are still accurate people are still wanting to risk there life for it.

Here are some reason why people want to risk there life to see this amazing

planet.The planet venus

a long time agp was the most earth like planet to be seen form astronomers.Venus had water like oceans life forms could've lived on

venus.

NASA is also working on another way to stude venus.

NASA uses some simplifed electornics made of slicon carbide.This has been tested on a chamber simulating chaos of venus's surface. NASA has tried to let the astomuners around the planet ,but it did not work.

Do you also think venus was like earth back in the day? How are earth,and venus alike? ",2

According to the article, Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

According to the article i paragraph 2 , In Venus since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. But this time can be changed.

For example in paragraph 7, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.

In conclusion, Venus can help with solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Also Venus is the most closest planer to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Don't the planet Venus can one they help us, the ""Evening Star.""      ",3
0c09020,"You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The program will allow you to experience many different adventures and go to many unique and eccentric places. One time my friend, Don Reist, and I went to New Orleans after the Pacific War had ended. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and we headed to Greece with the cargo of 335 horses with enough oats and hay to feed them. That was my first order, and I had fun.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, such as myself. Besides getting to help others, I had the side benefit of getting to see Europe and China. When I first went to Greece, I saw the Acropolis. I had also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. See, there are many adventures you can take on side of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One time when I was going to China, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings always kept me busy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luckily for me, helping my aunt Katie out on her farm as a boy had prepared me for hard work, just not for the dangers of the sea. As another example, if you had the experience I did of helping on the farm you have been slightly prepared with hard work.

One dark rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot my feet torward an opening on side of the ship. The only thing keeping me from falling overboard into the deep, dark, and dangerous Atlantic Ocean was a small strip of metal along the edge. I was really happy to still be alive. But, I couldn't work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs. I'll admit it, there some dangers working as a Seagoing Cowboy. But, the people there really look after you, and they care about you.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Participating in the program opened up a whole new world for me. I am really grateful for the opportunity. The program helped make me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.                 ",4
0c0b284,"With new technological advances everyday, it is no suprise that there will eventually be driverless cars out on the road. But technology is supposed to get the task at hand done more efficiently, and safer. And weighing the pros and cons of a driverless car, the cons win. With a driverless car, the driver would still have to pay attention to the road, creates conflict when a crash arouses (who is to blame, the driver or the car?) and the law doesn't agree with it either.

Driving is a skill that requires full attention to the road. Even with cars coming out with new assistant features, no car has yet to be fully driverless, as mentioned in paragraph 7. Even with actions such as steering, accelerating, and braking, the driver still must pay attenion to the road and would have to be notified by the car if a situation occured, also mentioned in paragraph 7.

It is rare that it is the manufacturers fault for when a car is involved in an accident. But this could change if driverless cars start appearing on roads.

Who would be to blame if the car were to wreck, the previously assured driver who believed their car was funtioning properly, or the car that promised to alert the driver if a problem were to arise? This idea is brought up in paragraph 9.

Lastly, driver laws are in place for the safety of the people and it is believed that it is best achieved with alert drivers. Many states have made it illegal to even test these driverless cars, according to paragraph 9. These illegal laws could change in the future, however, if driverless cars prove to meet safety standards maybe as that of a regular car.

Manufacturers are constantly trying to improve the quality and advances of their cars, but the question is are they taking a step in the right direction with driverless cars? As mentioned earlier, drivers would still have to be alert while driving these supposedly ""driverless"" cars, they would have to worry about whether it was their fault or the cars fault for an accident, and lawmakers would have to determine if these cars are safe enough to be driven on public roads. WIthout a doubt there will be driverless cars in the twenty-first century, but hopefully by that time, the pros will outweigh the cons. ",3
0c0eeb7,"My position on driverless cars is that I'm against with the driverless cars, because in paragraph 9 it said that it's waiting on the law. It talks about that most laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, but what ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?""

It going to take forever to figure out to se who fault it is, because 1 is going to be driver he didn't react fast enough and didn't try to stop it or just becasue is the owner's car is going to be the owner fault in paragrpah 7 said that manufacturers are considering putting cameras to watch drivers to remaining focused on the road, but there going to be some people that are going to agruement about privary with the camera in the car. Manufacturer is going to be there fault for not checking the technology to see if they will work. That something tht the supreme court or court doesn't what to go through. It sounds like a good idea to help the environment, would you less fossil fuel but there are still risk that can happen with the technology.

The introduction of this article about Driverless Cars Are Coming talks about how if you can see the future where no one buys cars. Well the Google cofounder Sergey Brin is trying to do see the future with public transportation system that are driveless.

Sensing the World in the late 1950s General Motors created a car that could run on a special test track, but how is it going to help in the open road with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car on each highway that the only why that car would be able to run. In the the smart road systems it worked but they need a lot of upgrades to existing roads, something that is to much to pay for. Without the smart road there is no driverless car on the road.

Driving or Assisting is talks about the antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream calling a cab that is driverless, but in the article Driverless Cars are coming to that 2013 BMW said that had devloped a system called the Traffic Jam Assistant that it help the car be handle driving the right speed up to 25 miles per hour. It the system makes the drive keeps its hand on the steering wheel. On the driverless car they can do is they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they have not meet the human skills, like driving through work zones and around accidents.",3

To start off, why would scientist lie about a possible life form on a different planet? If they had any evidence or clue there was life form, it would blow up fast. With information becoming so popular more people would take interest in the subject, resulting in more funds. If anything, scientist would want to find new life form.

Also, there has been a lot of photographic proof of it being a natural landform. There has been different pictures form a handfull of different times, wouldn't you think there would be some kind of evidence at all if it was really made by aliens?

0c1da05,"Why do scientists want to persue going to Venus? Is it the curiosity? Is it that they think they have found a possible substitute to Earth? In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that even thoug it may be dangerous to do, visiting venus is a worthy persuit. The reasons that the author states in the article are: Astronomers are fascinated by the planet, human curiosity, and because NASA is already planning it.

The first reason why the author said that the mission to Venus should be looked at is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus. They are fascinated because they believe that Venus is the closes thing to Earth, not only by distance but also because they are very similar. In paragraph 4 it is stated that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". So they want to discover and see if Venus still has the Earth like qualities to it.

Furthermore, the other reason the author gave as to why scientists are so interested in persuing the visiting to Venus is because humans are ery curious and because they think that the curiosity will lead to many things. On paragraph 8, the author explains that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally untimidating endeavors"" meaning that might as well trying it since we are going to try far worse stuff in the future.

Lastly, NASA already is planning to send people to research Venus, of course, they are taking many precautions and they are simulating the things that astronauts might face when they get there or near there. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow to float abov the fray"" as stated on paragraph 5, it would still be hot but they would be able to handle it. As they describe it ""Not easy conditions, but survuvable for humans""

In conclusion, the author gave some strong points as to why they think that the studying of Venus should be persuaded. They also gave a lot of information and supporting details to their claims. ",3
0c2a63d,"Smart cars can do things not all cars can do they can alert you to hit your breaks, steer for you, tell you when things are close around you and ect, but not always it will work so what would happen to the company if the car didn't do its job and someone gets hurt badly?

The author made good negaive arguments and made positive arguements about the driverless car. the author said ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are desgined to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" so hes giving you the postive things that smart cars can help people when they arent doing it themselves or when their not paying attention to the road. well just like the author said ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer"" that's something people should worry about caus eif the smart car doesn't do what is supposed to do if your not steering the wheel or if your not alert whats going on who would the blame for the accident the person driving or the company?

I think that not every smart car will do what they say they do all the time because it may not always know whats its surrounding of the car is so for people to just think the car will always do the right things their wrong. The smart car can have functions where how it should break when you get close to another car, but if the person driving doesn't hit the break and think the car will break its self and doesn't what will happen to the person when the police come will they get in trouble for not breaking when they could have did it themselves instead of thinking the car would have done it for them. ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times"" so by saying this just because you have a smart car and does so much for you while your not doing it your still in danger becaus ethe person behind the wheel should be steering the car to keep everything safe cause the smart cars can not always be safe for people to trust.

Smart cars are starting to take over because they think the smart car will be able to protect people while their not paying any attention, but their wrong smart cars are also dangerous and can put peoples life in danger becaus ethe car will not always be on top of its game and break for you or steer for you people are better off to pay attention to the road instead of letting a smart car do the job for them.",3

0c2f27d,"I think

that driverless cars are a good idea for tjhe majority of the time, but there are some people who will try and abuse the power of a driverless car. There were many negatives to using a driverless car like who is at fault when a accident occurs or who would want to drive a driverless car. I will tell you my argument for why I strongly believe that driverless cars are not so much of a good idea.

For my frist reason evin if there are some catious drivers in the U.S. there are more uncatious drivers than catious drivers. If we have driverless smart cars then people will be put at more risk then when they were manually operating of their vehicle. Also what if a malfunction occurs and one or more drivers or pedestrians get hurt then, ""who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer?"" says the article and I would believe that the manufactuer would be at fault but one would say otherwise.

My next reason is that a lot of driving laws would be altered or changed and more laws would be added. That is a big time consuming process and development would change every year with new designs, and other things of the sorts. With changing or adding laws people will start to loose their intrest in the car and look for something new in a manually operated vehicle. Most people would try and say that it is worth the wait but why wait for new technology that could malfucntion without alerting the driver like it says in the article about the development of the driverless car.

My final reason is that it is a big waste of money and could hurt one or more if not developed with the right technology and the right safety percaution are taken. The article says that there would be considerations of flashing lights in the windshield and this could be a big hazard because it could possabliy blind the driver also it could distract on coming traffic. The reason this would be a big waste of money is because if one were to get in a accident then there driverless car is completely totaled and rendered useless. Also with all the new features that would be added the cost of the car would be doubled most likely so this would be a very exspensive purchase for most who even considered trying the new technology.

In conclusion I have said for the most part a driverless car is pretty useful in many ways, but if you think about the big key which is safety then you would have to reconsider your choice. Even with the fact the car will be equip with many ways to alert the driver when it is time for them to take control it would just not work with the safety standards of most people. So really it all falls back on safety, so this is why I strongly believe that driverless cars are not a good idea.               ",4
0c34cc0,"Limiting car usage can be very beneficial. It would improve communities, reduce pollution, and create better lifestyles.

By reducing the usage of cars, you allow for your community to flourish in other ways than building or repairing roads. Since there would be less people driving cars, the community can focus on other things. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, because of the Day Without Cars, there have been 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been constructed. Also, ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city."" Old sidewalks are being replaced with new ones, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have also opened up. All of these great things are happening to the community of Bogota, Columbia, just because they have limited their usage of cars (source 3).

Also, limiting the use of cars would reduce pollution. In places like Paris, France, diesel has been blamed for Paris' days of nar-record pollution. Paris has more smog than most other European capitals, because they have more people driving cars (source 2). ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the US"" (source 1).

Finally, decreasing the usage of cars would create better lifestyles for people. People would be healthier and happier, because instead of driving around everywhere, they get some fresh air and more exercise. Heidrun Walter said that ""when [he] had a car [he] was always tense. [He is] much happier [not driving his car]"" (source 1). Also, don't you hate it when you're stuck in the rush-hour? In Bogota, Colombia, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic (source 3).

Reducing the usage of cars in any community would result in many great things. The community would be able to flourish, there would be less pollution, and people would be living better, happier lifestyles.    ",3
0c385a8,"Dear Senator

In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this contery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the magority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an acurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter. Now the question is acked, What is the point of voting if it does not matter who we vote for only the Electoral College votes matter?®                    ",4
0c3a8a0,"The author thinks, that exploring venus could be a dangerous thing to do because what he says about how other spacecraft landed there and how they didnt live for a few hour that , that is why spacecraft now have not gone to venus in over more than three decades. In paragraph two in the last sentence, it shows how he talked about spacecrafts.

The author also states how the tempeture is in venus in the third paragph, third sentence ,he talks about how hot it is in venus he said it is about over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and it also say¨beyond high pressure and heat,venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquaks,and frequen lighting.....¨

nasa is putting other lives at risk to go study venus, in paragraph five, frst two sentence it tell how nasa might have people go and discover more about venus.

My opinion on all of this that the author was talking about. It feels like a movie like,maybe in the future who knows when, we might have to go to venus because of something that happen in earth. we are going to leave homes and everything we worked on and live a new life in another planet. It kinda reminds me of that movie ¨Wall-e¨ they left earth nasty and a lot of poultion and went to live in a spacecraft in space.

0c4420d,"An argument against the development of these cars, we shouldn't have driverless cars for many reasons. They should not make driverless cars becacuse people need to learn how to do things on there own, and because there is enought electronices in thois world and enough things that don't need a human to work it anymore. Keeping the car as it is now in 2016 is better for the people because if we as people start making drivierless cars and they come big on day the world is just going to be lazy and never want to do anything for themselfs. Another thing is when teenagers start to learn how to dive they won't know how to because they have a car that does it for me and that's not good for us as people. It's bad enough that people are already getting to lazy to do something theirself and have other people do it for them just because they don't feel like getting up anymore. The whole thing of driverless cars sounds like a pretty good idea though, but then if we was to come out with them then people would start taking advange of theirself and other people and things, and they are going to expect electrioncs to do everything for them all the time and that's not good for the envirment it's self for all that. People would stop working anf looking for jobs because they are going to expect the electrioncs to do it all for them and they are going to expect to get paid for doing nothing. The more electrionc stuff that people come out with them more people aren't going to wanna do things for themself, they would rather have something that they can talk into and say what they want and get it right away, and just set bac anf relax because they don't have to do it by theirself.

0c442a8,"Venus is often known as the more dangerous 'twin' of Earth. It is located two planets away from the Sun but is hotter than Mercury, the planet next to the sun, even with it being further away. Although Venus is similar to Earth in size and a few other things, thick sheets of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid coat the earth, making it very difficult to research. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author presents reasons why Venus should be researched, despite the precautions scientists would have to take.

Visiting Venus does not indicate a need to be on the planet's surface. When thinking about being on and researching a planet, individuals would think about what it would be like to be visiting ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (3). A solution made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration claims they could possibly send scientists to Venus but instead of landing, they would ""float above the fray [of Venus]"" (5). This would allow scientists to do some more research on the difficult planet and keeping them safer by only introducing them to ""170 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""air pressure [that] would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). NASA is already introducing ideas that are very noteworthy and realistic for more exploration on the planet Venus.

Researchers are building machines and working innovatively to allow more time in Venus for further research. Years ago, rovers and spacecrafts were sent to Venus but ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (2). This information helps conclude how dangerous the planet is and how cautious scientists, researchers, and astronauts would have to be to visit or study more on. In recent years, NASA has worked more on building an electronic device completed with silicon carbide that ""lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" when ""tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface"" (7). This brings another level of excitement for the future of planet exploration because it extends the 'life expectancy' of the spacecraft. Some researchers have also been working on an old mechanical computer technology used in the 1800-1990s. They believe this may be effective on Venus because ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7) rather than more modern technology, which tends to be more fragile. The future of machines that could orbit Venus is worth pursuing for information and it may be a game-changer for all occupations wanting to learn more about the planet itself.

Although there are many valuable reasons as to why Venus is worth studying for, the author includes some evidence that indicate why Venus exploration is not succeeding as well. It is evident that the planet is clearly not accustomed for human settlement. The author reveals to the audience that ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3). This explains why a person has not visited and how deathly it would be if someone did. While the author explains how humans can explore even just above the clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, there is also evidence that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (6). Despite these facts given, the article ends with ""our travels onEarth and beyond should not be limited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8) and this contributes to why visiting Venus is worth it, making all the reasons against visiting less effective because they are not explained as thoroughly throughout.

Even with all the evidence and reasoning behind why the earth is too dangerous to study, the author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit as it is a challenge for the future of space exploration. Scientists and researchers have all the information they need to figure out a plan so they can pursue active studying on the planet Venus. With all precautions aside, Venus is worth spending time on if they can figure out how to do it effectively without too many troubles and hassles. ",5
0c47509,"Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by Aliens. Many Web sites, magizenes and people do not have enough information to correcty assume that the Face on Mars is an Alien monument or creation. Many people just guess without really having adiquite information. We do have enough information to know that when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Mars and took pictures of the Face it was not Alien made.

We know for a fact that the Face on Mars is not an Alien creation. The first Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) or the Viking 1 took blurry photos of the Face on Mars and we could not clearly see the object. Twenty-five years later the MGS was sent to take better quality pictures of the Face and when it came back, the photos were ten times more sharper than the Viking 1´s. Now we could clearly speculate that the Face was just another Mars landform.

On Earth there are simialr landforms like the Snake River in Idaho. We have found that the Face is a lava dome under the surface of Mars. We understand how much of an influence the Media can have and you shouldn´t believe them. Again, they do not have as much information as we do on the Face on mars. Thanks to our new pictures from the MGS, we can safely say that there is no Alien temple or monument on Mars.        ",3
0c488ee,"Hi I'm Michael, and I will be talking too you about Seagoing Cowboys. In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves it talks about Luke and it takes on a journy that he had. A Seagoing Cowboy is a person that transport animals across the sea to other countrys and states. You get to sail the world by bost with animals.

When, you sail the world you see so much more and meet a lot more people. If you sail the world it is a beatiful thing to see with your eyes before you die. You get to see how others live and the animals. Plus world beond the state you live because life is so much more.

Plus when you become a Seagoing Cow boy you get to see and meet all kinds of different animals. It opens your mind too other animals and where they live. You can deliver animals from lizards to tigers all types of animals. On your why back too home all the creates with animals are gone so you get to play games. Like it said in the story they play volleyball and have table tennis touraments and best of all baseball.

Just imangine seeing all the different animals and places. Just like in the story exchange visitors you will see and get to meet. Plus playing those games with your friends and having fun. Thats why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.",2
0c4ede2,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author gives us positive information and negative information. Different people are going to have different opinons on driverless cars. Some may think it is a good idea while some may think that it is a bad idea. There is no right or wrong answer. It is based on your personal opinion on what you think of driverless cars. I believe that it is kind of dumb to have driverless cars. There are many bad things that can happen with them such as safety hazards, unattentiveness while driving and accidents that may occur with them.

Driverless cars are not a good idea to me. When you drive you always have to be attentive. Driving is already not the safest thing in the world. There is always people walking out in front of you, animals running out in front of you and many other things. If you get a car that can drive for you there is bound to be something bad to happen. A computer is all that the car is. Computers go down all the time in the world and they shut down. What if your car happened to stop working in the middle of the highway where the speed limit is seventy-five miles per hour. There would be many accidents happening if that was the case. There is a positive thing about them though they can help you if you have children in the backseat. If they are acting up and you put your car on autopilot then you can get them to quit arguing. But still it is a very dangerous idea. No way would I trust a car to be able to drive me places when I barely trust myself driving me places. So I don't believe that these cars are one hundred percent safe. I think that there are many safety hazards that they could bring.

I also think that driveless cars are a bad idea because no matter what you have to be attentive. If you look away to the side for three seconds and your driving, your car is already the that side of the road. I believe that if there is going to be television and stero systems in these cars, that people are not going to be paying attention to the road, they are going to be paying attention to the televsion or whatever may be on in theirr car. When I drive I listen to the stero and it distracts me when a good song comes on. I could not imagine what I would be like if I had a television in my car. The good side about these driverless cars with televsion in them is that if you are going on a long road trip with your family and you want to watch televison you could. I know that when I take long road trips I wish that I could bond with the person that is driving. So it would be a good thing for families that had little ones. If the little kids were getting cranky then they could cuddle up next to mommy or daddy or whoever may be driving. But again the driver would not be attentive or aware of there surrroundings if that was to happen. They would probably fall asleep if they were relaxing to much and dozed off.

Finally I believe that these cars can cause many highway or country road accidents. For example, if a family was watching a movie and their was a sudden stop on the road they are most likely going to run right into that person in front of them. If it is a sudden stop there is no way a computer can see that and slam on the brakes. If it could do that though, the person behind the car would probaly get ran into. Like I have said in the beginning all this car is, is a computer. I mean my computer goes down so many times in a day. I would not rely on a computer made car for the life of me. There are already so many accidnets that happen when people are driving, there is no need to add a computer made car and let it make accidents to. I think that for a car to be completely driverless or ninty percent driveless is ridiculous. On the plus side of this if a car that was driveless did happen to work then it would come in handy for long trips on the road. If there was a actual car that got tested and it could go on for hundreds of thousands of miles and not wreck now that would be pretty amazing. But in my opinon I do not think that there is a car that is capable of being able to do that. A car takes human assistance to drive and if it all technology no way could it work effectively. There is going to be accidents if cars become ninty perfect driveless or any percent driveless

This concludes my opinion on driveless cars. I think that they would be a very neat invention but I do not believe for one second that they would work all the tie one hundred percent. I have been driving for a year now and have already been in accidents because I was not paying attention. So I know that being a human and driving is already complicated enough, I do not believe that a computer could handle it. I know that companies are trying their best to make this become an actual thing in the world but I don't think that it is belivable. I think that they could make them, I just do not believe that they would work that great. I am with the idea that there is no way

driveless car is even imaginable. So with the facts I have presented here I am sticking to my topic that driveless cars are the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. ",4
0c560ab,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studying Venus is worth it because we still dont have enough information to explain others about it. The people that go to it can gain more information, tell us how things are, how things move, and how they see things that are different from earth.

One reason people should go to explore Venus it to discover how the weather is there. In the passage it said that ""Venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" This is not abnormal for a planet that is second from the sun. I imagine that it would be really hot because if earth is hot Venus is nine times more, which would be around 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Another reason is that you can go to venus to see how to surface is transformed. The scientist said ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supposted various forms of life, just like Earth."" This means you have the danger of stepping into something that you dont even know if its going to be ground or water with grass that makes it look like land. You can also be an danger because you dont know if the surface is really hot or cold.

My final reason on how the author supports the idea stuying is worhty but danger is because People can check how techonology is there, or maybe if they have more advance technology then there is in Earth. For example it said "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"" That gives them an idea of how smart technology was in Venus. Another example was "" Modern computers are enormouslwy powerful, flexible , and quick , but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical condition."" This means that the technology is good it just depends on the nature things like weather.

Those are reason on why the author suggest why people should go visit Venus although it might be dangerous, People also want to learn more about it but we dont have enough information because people dont go explore Venus.",3
0c5c345,"I think driverless cars are a cool invention but it can also be dangers if something malfuctions or breaks like the brakes for the car, i have seen videos of the testing for these cars and a man got injured badly to the point he had to co to the hospital, so i stand at the side that we should not be making these cars for they are not safe.

The cost rate to build one of these cars can be really high becouse they need lots of sensors so that it can see what is in front of it and behind it, it has a part that is a radar so it can sence things around the car but this small part can cost of to 2 hundred million dollars.

And manufactures are considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road, which is a vialation of privacy to the driver who buys the car, and if something does happen like a part on the car breaking who would get blamed the owner of the car of the manufactures that designed and built the car?, there are many things we still need to think about that would come with driverless cars.

I stand with the side that we should not have driverless cars becouse it will take the skill that is earned by driving away from those who have already learned to drive and people would get so dependent on the car driving its self and until it comes to the point that if something happens on the road the car will make the driver take control but if the driver is used to the car driving it self then that could lead to more problems that could not only put the driver in danger but anyone else that is in the car with them or any car that is around them.",2
0c5e863,"Based on what i have read from this passage i'm for the development of driveless cars . I am for this because this here is a very good opertunity to show that how much adavnce techonolgy has gotten over the years and to show that cars have came a long way way for it to be where it is today .the reasons that im for the the driverless cars is because

the driver have less things to worry about, and there would be less car crashes

The first reason on why i am for driverless cars are because drivers less thigs to worry about.the reason i said this is because in paragraph 8 it states '' that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use heads up display. such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not available to ddrivers trying to text with a cell phone .in this way the in car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern '' this quote shows that drivers has less things to worry about and not have to get into crashes.

But there is some that might say that there isn't a law yet saying that computers shouldn't be driving a car and the driver should always be behind the wheel. this will pose a problem for the near future google is still trying devlop these cars no matter the cost ",2
0c5ec1c,"The ""Face of Mars"" is clearly a natural landmark that, in a low resolution camera, looked like a face. Until there is proof of life on Mars, there is not a single chance that something couldv'e made this. It is actually a very common mesa on Mars and this is why it cannot be man-made.

First of all, the photo taken at first and released to the public was not very good. The difference between the photo from 1976 and 2001 is extremely noticable. The picture from 1998 looks the most like a face, but it is still quite a stretch to say that it is a face. The high-resolution images and 3D altimetry completely disproves it and shows what it really, a mesa.

Now some skeptics might say that NASA might be unreliable and might have changed the photo. There are two things wrong with that arguement. If NASA had discovered new life on Mars, they would most defineitly share it with the public. Everyone would know that there were other lifeforms on other planets, and this would be extremely benificial to NASA. They would get all the funding they need to do more exploration deeper into space. They would get more scientists interested in making technology for space travel. They would get more brave volenteers for space travel. The second thing wrong is the difference between sources of information. All the info people have about the face is either from NASA itself and pop culture like movies or magazines. So if you trust magazines and movies more than a well supplied and well known orginazation like NASA, then you don't have as reliable sources making your own arguement not very believable.

In conclution, skeptics don't have any reliable proof that hasn't been already disproven.",3
0c61969,"I dissagree with the fact that the state wants to keep favor of electoral college. I think they should change the way the whole election is set up by using popular vote for the presedent of the united states. To me the election should be based on what the people wants and what they think is best not on electoral college. Electoral vote is also unfair to the people who vote because of the winner-takes-all system is certain states.

Yes richard nixon, jimmy carter, bob dole, the u. s chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO agreed on electoral college but electoral college is when the voters vote for the state electors who the vote for president. there is an arguement called the disaster factor also and thats the single best argument against the electoral college. Thats why popular vote for president is better than electoral because there is a better possibility of the majority of people winning.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it officail !!!. Also arguments against direct elections are apurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.    ",2
0c63220,"Using the technology called the Facial Action Coding System is not useful to students if a student wants anyone else know how he/she is feeling the student will allow it, there's no reason why a student should have them forced out of them. If a student is in the subject of photography or painting anything artistic FACS would be very useful indeed, but if a student has no interest in any part of it they will not take it serious. Now someone who is starting a business or wants to pursue a sream and be a great artist such as Leanardo da Vinci they will find FACS helpful, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, For example if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a smiliar ad might follow."" It will allow them to see how a client feels about the artists work or how they're feeling that day maybe it's not a good day to take photos or such. The work that goes into FACS is great the ways they compare a persons facial muscles to a photo with no emotion to simply see the difference that much easier. Taking anatomy would be such a good help if intrested and to make it way easier to figure out a persons facial changes that much eaiser. ""Studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey a specific emotions."" FACS a good project that was developed but it has no big use for students, their feelings shouldn't be forced if you're doing something for the student they should go ahead and be open about it ""MOst human communication is nonverbal, including emotinal communication."" allow someone to see how they truly feel. An artist could get their feelings hurt by working with a client and then seeing how they truly feel about their work or about doing the project. You can't really just get emotions from someone with a quick snapshot you really have to put work in taking the photo so you get their true emotions. FACS is a great project for someone in the industry of art not everyone wants to know how a person feels based on a photo, I would say, I am against the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions.

0c66cb3,"Have you ever wished you could just sit back and let your car do all the driving? Well that may happen sooner than you might think. Driverless cars technology is improving everyday and soon it will be more accessible to more people. Driverless cars are cars that do all the driving for you. You still have to be in the car ready to take over in case of an emergency. Driverless cars may sound like a cool idea but there is a lot of debate over this topic.

Personally, I think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think since we have the advancing technology we should give driverless cars a try. You would still have to be in the car ready to take control and I think that is a good idea. The problem with driverless cars is that they won't be ready for unexpected danger on the road. A good way to solve this problem is to have a driver ready to take the wheel.

A benefit of driverless cars is that they would use half the fuel taxis use and be more flexible than a bus. Reducing how much fuel we use would really help the environment. I think more people would supprt the idea of driverless cars if they knew the benefits like reducing the use of fuel.

The biggest negative effect of driverless cars is the safety. Since there is not a person behind the wheel ready to react there is a bigger risk of collisions. A computer doesn't have the time to react in that type of situation. Right now California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Comumbia are the only states allowing semi-autonomous cars to be driven. Manufacturers of these cars believe that other states will follow as soon as driverless cars are proven more reliably safe.

I really think driverless cars will be here soon in the future for everyone to drive. With developing technologies it will probably happen sooner than you might think. There are many positive and negative effects, but I think the manufactures will work them out. Driverless cars will be a positive effect on the environment and society. ",3
0c6c628,"Driverless cars are not safe at all! Manufacturers arent even to sure if humans are able to last a day in that car without it stopping or blowing up on them. I think that manufacturers need to do a lot more study on driverless cars if they think people will by them. Also driverless cars are going to probably cost millions of dollars and if they think in the future no one will buy normal cars they need to think agian. I understand that driverless cars are very helpful but it is not the best choice when it comes to money. For example Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot only 90% of the time. Another reason driverless cars are not the best is because what if the technology fails and someone gets injured I wonder who`s fault it would be the driver or the manufacturer. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver, it would be very boring having to wait for your turn to drive. If paying millions on a driverless car i might a well take the bus or a taxi for a cheap amount instead of buying a car that can stop a any time because i dont know whats going to happen at any time.

0c6cb29,"Reckless drivers are dangers, they have no care for the world or people who are in it. One point of evidence is that in 2013, BMW announced the development of the '' Traffic Jam Assistant''. So this means that when you are driving up to 25 mph you have a smart car , but when you go over 25 mph you have just a normal car . See the point that I'm trying to make is that when people had a little bit to much to drink and they go over 25 mph they're like a missle that can blow up at any time. Some sensors on the car may fail while you are driving , lets say if your driving down the street in a BMW at 20 mph and a car passes you and your not looking and you happen to run into it, its the cars fault and the owner because the driver should've been looking and the car should've stop on the dime. Because BMW developed this new System and its mention in paragraph 7 '' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph , but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Also mention by BMW ''They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themsevles. So if the driver in this situation was looking down at a phone lets say ,and runs into the back of someones car who's fault would it have been ? I would have blame the manfacturer company because they said that the car is supose to brake themselves if danger is near or coming up . So if the owner was hurt then it would've been on manufacturer company all because they said that this car had sensors that could alert the drivers. Also which leads to another point lets say that the sensors fail without the driver knowing and she was driving a little bit reckless then that would been her fault and the cars. So I think that people should stop driving so reckless and start paying attention to the road . Also I think that a new law should be passed saying that car companies should recall their cars every 5 to 6 years to upgrade the safety quality on their cars. This will safe a numerous amout of people's lives and increase the amount of cars being sold by BMW. ",2

Scientists have figured out that the life like face found on Mars was just another Martian Mesa, the was common enough found around the Cydonia on Mars, but only this particular one of the most unusual rocks the made a shadow that makes it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh face.

Cars should not drive them selfs, even though that would be a good idea most people like me wouldnt go for it. yes it has been proven That less wrecks are caused. But if your like me youd want control over your car no matter what. It could mess up and wreck you into a tree you'd never be able to tell if you were about to wreck because you didnt have control.

Do i think its a good idea ? Yes and no. would I ride in a car that had control over its self ? No.

I think the smarter roads is a way better idea. But there is a down fall to that. It would take way to long to cover the world in ""smarter roads."" We dont have time to wait. people should just drive responable or don't drive at all!

One reason i would disagree is becuase that doesnt make sense. Another reason i would disagree is because How can aliens make faces? I mean Come on now, I honestly think the face of mars was made by the people who lived way before we did. In the passage it talks about when they found it, IT states that some astronaunt went to space and was exploring and came along the face, They were very amazed, So they decided to capture a picture of the face and showed the word the next day, as you read in the text.

My first reason why i support the idea is that it would be a great way to save you time and allow you also accomplish more tasks in your day. For instense you could do paper work, phone calls, homework and many other tasks. But i would only support this idea if it was safe and would not brsomething to complicated to handle if there were to be a accident. A great exaple is in paragragh 9 when it says ""if technology fails and someone is injured , who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer"". This is what probaly would make msot of the laws think more in depth and question the idea more.

The next reason i would support this idea is it would be a very extriodinary to see on daily basis when going to work or school. A example would be for this would be in paragraph two when it ways ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could dirve themselves"". Which to date i think people are still waiting to see if this idea were to come true.

My final reason would be it is a fun thing to ahve and drive. A example of this is in paragraph eight when the BMW project manager driver says ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way"". Like everything it would get old eventually but also there would

most likely be new add-ons to the idea or newer self driving cars coming out yearly.

In conclusion i would agree to have to this idea be made possible worldwide. Like i said it would be a great way to save time, a fun car to have, and lastly only if it would be safe. All in all i think many people would like to see this idea come to live.",3
0c76a09,"My claim to do studying on Venus is saying no I think spending so much time and money on something that has been tempted to do multiple times and failed is wasteful. Because we have tried on numerous accaions and have got just a few hours with a little bit of information it is not worth it. Researchers know that they only get a super small time to only see a little bit of a huge planet.

Knowing that Venus is a whole planet the size of earth and only getting to see just a tiny bit of it is like starting at one side of the United States and then driving only a few hours to see how far you get, If you are trying to go all the way around the world to get back to the same spot but only have a few hours to do so, you don't cover much of anything to have any real say of how the world looks in different areas if you haven't seen it all yet.

Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform. One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa.

Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien. Hopefully now you agree with me and think it was just a natural landform too. Also I hope that you have come to your senses and now think that aliens are not real.       ",2

0c88bb6,"It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keeps things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or elect a horrible president, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes put in to elect a president.

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states ""other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president""(Posner,19). The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearences but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try tp evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy.    ",4
0c8a07d,"If you like to help people out the Seagoing Cowboy program is one you must join. There are many great reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys so I thought of two reasons why. The first reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because It's a good chance for you and others to help the people that are in need. Another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to explore and learn new things along the way,and according to the author It could be a opportunity of a lifetime for you.

According to the article the author said ""Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation"" and ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" The author also says ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him"" and ""It made me more aware of people of othert countries and their needs.""

Being in the Seagoing Cowboys could be amazing for you. You not only get to help save lives but you also get to explore and learn new things along the way. Not only do you get to do that but you also have the chance to go to many places and meet many people and the impact it has on the world is just amazing. Those are all reasons why you and your friends or family should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",2
0c8abe3,"Strike! A comett just struck Mars. Where the comett hit looks like an animal of some sort, but there are also many things on earth that look like it could have been made by man or something else. The Face on Mars was not made by man or aliens.

The Face and many other formation are pretty common aroung the Cydonia. Shadows can also give the alusion that the Face has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. In addition, scientists have proven that the Face is not made by aliens and that it was made by a natural cause. Then they started taking more pictures.

The first picture shows that it was just taken when there were clouds and couldn't really tell what it showed. They waited for a day without clouds and took another photo. The picture they got clearly showed that the Face wasn't made by aliens and was just a land form.

The scientists proved it was a land form by comparing it to others similar to those on earth. When word got out it was kind of disapointing for the public. There were so many movies about the face on mars and it stayed for a long time.

The face was never made by aliens. It was nothing more than a mesa or a land form. Also if anyone tries to say that aliens were the ones who made the Face on Mars, don't believe them. It was probably made by a comett or one of those storms that Mars has every now and then. ",3
0c8f97b,"The Electoral College is not a place, but a process. It was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The college consists of electors, which vote for President and Vice President. The College consit of many electors, about 538 that is. There is a certain number of votes that is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president is his or her own group of electors. The candidate's political party usually chose the electors. Election is held every four years in November on the first Tuesday. There is usually something called a ""winner-take-all"" system, it awards the winners of the presidential candidate. People should agree of keeping the Electoral College because without it, countires would not have presidents or vice presidents. Most people don't understand the use of the Electoral College. I think that there should be someone going out to jobs and schools talking to the the new generation and the people with jobs about this Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote, not for president, but for a state of electors, so what do you think our country would look like without this? For instance if you lived in Texas, and you wanted to vote for David Mark, you'd have to vote for about 34 Democratic electors pledged to Mark. People always seem to argue about this Electoral College, we calll it a disastor factor. American's should consider them selves lucky for the big election crisis that happened in a century. Some people think the electoral college is unfair to voters, only because of the winner-take-all system. During one of the campaigns, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. People say that the electoral college is unfair; outdated, and irrational.

Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee.

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College;

1) Certainly of Outcome- A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible 2) Everyone's President- The electoral College requires as presidential candidate 3) Swing States- The winner-take-all system of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates 4) Big States- The electoral college restores some of the wight in the political balance.

5) Avoid run-off elections- The electoral college avoids the porblem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

People still continue to argue about the Electoral College method of selecting the president. that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats. The Electoral College is a good thing. Vote for President and Vice President and your country will be on top.    ",2

The name of this job is the seagoing cowboy program. This argument will be about the reasons you should join the progrm and deatails about the program.

My first reason is you get to travel to cool places in the article it says they traveled to places in europe for Example China. They also went to Greece,Venice Italy. So like i said in the beggining this will be very good for travaling.

My second reason will be you can help cities from wrold war two. In the passage it says ""In 1945 world war two was over in Europe, and many cities were left in ruins"". It would be a great thing to do if you helped the people hwo lived there and you will be happy about it.

My third reason will be you get two take care of animals and hwo does not like animals. In the story they take care of animals on a boat and take's them to diffrent countries. Animals are fun to take care of think ot them as your pet.

How would you get to places. Would we put the adress of where we want to go or tell the car with our voices where to take us. If the car dosent respond to tht then what do we do push the car NO. I dont think driverless cars are a good idea. Also we wouldnt have to have a driver licence to drive a driverless care. Someone can be 14 and drive on of those.

0c9e34e,"The emotional expressions in a classrooom is valuable because many people have many different expressions. Using technology would be a good idea to tell the different types of expresions because imagine someone being really mad and you did not know. I think technology would be a good idea because they could have many different options to choose from.

For example on paragraph 3 it gives really good reasons on why technology would be good. It show that a computer can construct a 3-Dmodel face showing all 44 mucles in our face and it would move like actual human muscles. The movement of our muscles are called action units. We have would have six emotions to tell to someone and a computer could do it all by its self.

We humans may have the same expression on a daily day basis because most of the time we are not happy consedering the fact that most of our facial expressions are angry, sad , happy , surpris fear, and disgust, so this means that with just a computer you can do anything when it comes to facial expresions. Also on paragraph 4 it says that '' using video imagery'' would be really good to tell the emotions through facial movements or on a painting like Mona Lisa. A new software would be good to tell the facila emotions for example like on the masterpice of da Vinci that the expressions are compared to the natural face of a person.

This idea of computer emotional expressions would be a good one because with just a scan or a picture would be great because they wouldn't have to be asking the person what is wrong with them. I think this would be way much easy to tell wheather the person is mad, sad, or surprised this idea would work also on pictures that may not show no expressions

In my opinion i think this would cause good controversials because your emotions would simply be easy to reach like in Mona Lisa picture. Your expression can change real quick as to when your standing in the mirror or when you are really happy , sad, or mad. This would help for when a person is showing a fake smile or when a celebrity is being truthful with the camras. This would be a great idea in the future because it would help alot of photographers and scientist that want to look over a picture and tell your facial emotions such as anger, sadness, surprised , disgust, and fear. These would be part of improtant and many more facial emotions.",3
0cae471,"The auhtor begins with information about Earth's twin, known as Venus, has been a scientific question for decades. One of the brightest points of light in the sky and somewhat the closest planet to earth looks and proximity wise, is in fact Venus. Venus may be very easy to see from a long distance, but the closer you get the more danger you are in. There are manyreasons on why scientists and astronomers keep going back to venus and attempting after many fails.

Considering that Venus is sometimes, depending on the speed in which Venus orbits the sun, the closest planet there are hardships on why humans cant land a spacecraft on it. Sending a spacecraft to Venus has been done numerous times, but not one survived more than just a few hours. This issue has caused Nasa to be discouraged and havent sent a spacecraft in over three decades. "" each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours""( paragraph.2) This is just one reason on why Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study.

The author states that Venus' atmosphere holds clouds made of sulfuric acid which is highly corrosive, melting most metals into liquid. On the surface, tempatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit as an average. Venus has the hottest surface tempature in our whole solar system. The air pressure is 90 times in what we experience on our own planet. These condiotions are far more worse than what an average person encounters on Earth, let alone a professional astronaut. Venus' environment alone could combust a submarine made to withstand the deepest parts of our oceans. The author also says that Venusian weather and geology have presented additional information such as erupting volcanoes, frequent lightening strikes, and powerful earthquakes. So why does the author think that studying Venus is worth these dangers?

The author found that scientists are discussing further visits to Venus becasue once a long time ago Venus might have been home to various forms of life. The planet holds a surface of rocky terrain and similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Given the long time frames of space travel, Venus is the nearest option, yet still isnt safe enough. "" the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" ( paragraph 2). NASA brought forth a very compelling idea for sending humans to Venus in order to study the planet. NASA's solution is for humans to hover above Venus' harsh ground conditions at 30 or so miles above the landscape. Temperatures will still be at a whopping 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and air pressure similar to sea level on Earth. Not easy but survivable for humans, this is the best idea NASA could provide. Although seeing Venus from a blimp like ship hovering safely above the planet would provide only limited insight on ground conditions, because some forms of light cannot penetrate Venus' dense atmosphere. As well as sight, astronauts cannot take samples from 30 plus miles in the air of the gas, rocks, or soil.

Despite these hardships, NASA is formulating other approaches to studying Venus. The author provided examples on their ideas such as simple electronics made of silicone carbide have been put in a chamber simulating the chaotic nature of Venus, and survived at least three weeks in these conditions. In conclustion the author supported this idea very well, and had a lot of information about the hardships and ideas formulating our jpurney to study Venus. I think that we will find the answer someday and unlock the many secrets that Venus' harsh conditons and unfriendly nature have kept hidden for so long. "" Our travels on Earth snd beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" ( paragraph 8) ",5

0cb54b1,"I think we should change the electoral college to the popular vote for many reasons. I think that the electoral college causes alot of disgreements and agruements.

We should all be equal like the George washington wanted us to be as he and many others signed the US Constition and The Declartion of Independence. Like Cali. has 55 electrolal votes and wyoming has like 4 how does that make them feel.

If one President is like by the whole nation then he should become president no doubt. Just because someone else get more elctoral votes but isnt the popular why should he be President.

0cc9cb5,"The electoral college is pointless, I believe that it is just another step that was added to the long process of picking our new president. It causes problems between the people and the government and it takes away time that we could be using to do something actually beneficial to our country. The electoral college is not a place but a group of people who meet and vote for the President and Vice President. Each state gets represented by a certain amount of electors which is decided by the population of that specific state. The electoral college should be thrown out of the way that we choose our president becuase it upsets the people, it can completley change elections, and because it gives to much power to the legislative branch.

I think that the electoral college gets people frustrated with our government. They have to go basically vote for another person to vote. If I lived in texas I would go to a poll and vote for the person that I wanted to put up in the electoral college. That person would then vote for the president. It makes voters, mad why spend time for voteing on people who you dont really care about when you could honeslty just vote for the President who you believe could help our country. The biggest argunment against the electoral college is that it we can't control who our elector votes for. You see when you go to vote for an elector you normally vote for one who says that they are going to vote for the person that you like, but they can change their mind and now you voted for someone that is going to vote for the candidate that you didnt want.

The electoral college can completely change the direction of a vote. Becuase voters only have one vote, the electors represent alot of the states population. For example a single representitive from samller states like Wyoming can represent of to 500,000 voters and in bigger states like California can have up to 55 electors who represent as much as 35 million people. This is why the electoral college can have such a big effect on the voting proces exspecially since the electors represent such a large amount of people. It can become frustrating when a large mass of people ellect some one and that elector changes there mind about  who they vote for, because a group of people as large as 500,000 can be ruiting for one person and the elector can change his mind and now that group 500,000 is voting for someone that they don't like.

Another problem is that the electoral college gives to much power to legislative branch ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy becuase it would have been overthrown by the college. Which meens that the Legislative branch has enough power to create a biased slait. The legislature would create a group of electors that are all in favor of certain idea and you wouldnt be able to vote for anyone else becuase those are the people for your state. The point of voting is to give power to the people and with the electoral college in the way it completely takes that away from us. We get to vote for the electors but that doesnt meen that they are going to vote for the people that we want them to.

Yes the electoral college could have some advanteges like allowing professionals to have an input into what is going on, It helps us avoid run-off elections (elections that end up with a tie), and restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here. If we get rid of the electoral college it will make the people happier and allow them to actually feel like part of the government, It will stabilize elections and not allow the legistaure to change them, and will take away some of the numerous powers that the Legislative branch holds. All in all the electorla cllege os unfair, outdated, and irrational. It need to be abolished!            ",5
0cd1679,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests stuydying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. NASA is working to try to get as much data and informaton about venus as possible, only because soon we could all have a space trasvling place to go to thats nearlry the same as earth one day farther in studying and knioowing about venus, it is called eaths twin.

In the pasage it states ""Thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challengeing are the clouds of higghly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus in venuss atmosphere. On the planets surface, temperatures avaerage over 800 degrees fahrenheit"". This shows why they was considering cars that hover over the land 30 miles up because us as humans wouldnt be able to be on the ground that long survivable level's but still dangerous levels of toxic to breath.

They think venus may have life likely such as ours because at a point of time venus was half percent water and could have living things on it and alsohave closly matching looking vallys and mountains like ours, they are rally trying to take a closer look into studying and possibably making there way up to finally seeing it. In the passage it states.""Venus was probablyciovered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.....

0cd7e90,"The author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very clearly and effectivly. He supports his idea by stating how much its like Earth but its corroive atmosphere, weather, and the atmospheric pressure are to extreme for humans to encounter with. He then talks about NASA plans to approach Venus and how at one point it may have had oceans,mountains, and varous life forms like Earth.

The author states Venus is often reffered to as Earths ""twin"" because it is the closest in terms of size and density, and sometimes in distance. When Venus is closest to us, humans have sent many different spacecrafts there to explore the planet. Each of the ships were unmanned since every landing was terminated after a few hours. This was due to the dangerous environment of Venus.

The author also states thst Venus has a very harsh and inhospitable environment. Its atmosphere is 97 percemt carbon dioxide and they are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Venus's surface on average is over 800 degrees fahrenheit. He talks about the planets atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earths. The author also states what type of weather the planet offers which is said to be erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. The author then asks a question to himself; if the planet is so inhospitable why is NASA still wanting to take visits to its surface.

The author answers back by saying the Astronomers are fascinated by Vesus because it may well once been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The author says long ago Venus was probable covered in oceans and could support life forms similiar to Earth. Venus is said to stilll have some features that are analogoous to those of Earth. The author states that NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions would alow scientists to float above the harsh surface although the tempertures would still be hot but the air pressure would be closest to sea level on Earth.

Thus stating all support of his research of Venus's dangers and possible history he supports his main idea to us without confusion and going off topic. He states clearly what his purpose and idea was.",3

First off, the founding fathers created the Electoral process. The Electoral process is a simple but complex system that holds up are government. The system protects us from people accidentaly picking a leader that may end up being a tyrent or worse. Many people may say ""What about Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, or bob Dole."" Well it's vary likely that there will be more people like that if we change the system and start a new.

Even though, citizens of the USA think that the Electoral Collage is Anachronism. That statement is not true. If the Electoral collage was outdated the U.S. would the government system would have fallen awhile ago. even if there may be ties between the Electoral collage the system will have a plan B. While I'm Electoral collages the representives of the state are chosen by the people if the wrong disison was made people should balm the people who chose that person.

In the end, the people are the one to blame not the system. The system may have a few flaws but the flaws are only made by the people vote. Some one may say ""If the system was perfect there whould be no need for blame."" but nothing can be purfect.""

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because she thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens. I've did some research and i have all the answers to your questions Mrs. Backbone. Let's Get Started! "" Few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact and i think they are right"" said Mrs. Backbone. "" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and she was speechless.

Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions she needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook her head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen her roll her eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?""

Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told her On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I also told her on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."" She asked me ''Was that all?'' Ms. Breadwill told Mrs. Backbone one last thing and it was "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Mrs. Backbone had all her questions answered, so I believe that my work here is done!

I am Ms. Breadwill,and I am a scientist at NASA. If you need questions answered about the Face on Mars, then I am the one to help you. I will answer all your questions whether they are easy or very difficult. I believe I am the best scientist in all America.",3

0cdf1ff,"Having a new technology that can detect facial expression is not valuable in classrooms. Having technology that can detect when a student is enjoying a specific lesson or action, is not valuable due to the fact that the student's facial expression may have more to do with than just the lesson being learned. The Facial Action Coding System would be able to tell if a student is sad or happy, or frusterated, or disgusted. But it does not have the technology to determine prior emotions, or the cause of them. Therefore, Facial Action Coding Systems are not valuable in classrooms. However they may be useful elsewhere, such as doctors offices, and airports.

Although the author gives a practical use of his product, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a studnet is becoming confused or bored."" Students go through a fair amount of stress throughout the year, and can witness or partake in many activities which can be detromental. This is where the author's claim is no longer valid.

For instance, maybe a second grader gets into school one day, and is distrought because his or her mom and dad got in a divorce the night prior. This is a scenario where the Facial Action Coding System is not going to be able to benefit the kids learning based off of his or her facial expressions. Another example includes highschoolers. What if a boy or girl is being bullied and not reaching for help and bottling all of their emotions in. A system that recognizes facial expression would not be worth having at that time because the system would base its opinion off of what the student is learning, even if the student may be enjoying what they are learning. This is just one case where the Facial Action Coding system would not be valuable.

Although the Facial Action Coding System may not be useful in school classrooms, their is practical application outside of the classroom. For instance, what if a little kid gets signed out of school because they are sick. The mom would most likely take the kid to the doctors to get them examined, if they are truly sick the Facial Action Coding System may be useful to tell if the kid is truly sick, or if they are most likely faking it, prior to the actual visit with the doctor. It may also be useful in principals offices. The Facial Action Coding System may be of use when a student makes a report. If the students emotions can be told as angered, or distraught, it may further prove that the student is actually being truthful, not just trying to get someone in trouble.

Another great use of the Facial Action Coding System is in airports around the world. The system could be of use to tell if someone is of threat or is in an unstable condition prior to boarding the plane. Airport officials could analyze reults of suspected threats before allowing them on a plane. This application would be more practical than it being used in classrooms.

Although I believe that the Facial Coding System is not of use in classrooms, the technology would be great if applied elsewhere. The authors opening sentence in paragraph nine may be the solution to classrooms. ""Putting on a happy face actually works."" This small quote may help lighten a students day more so than a system trying to fix what is wrong by changing what they are learning. ",5
0ce3c1c,"The use of this technology called the Facial Action Coding read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it will be very benefitile for the schools. The schools needed this technology to identify the emotional expressions of the students. Sometime things happen in school that the teachers don't know about; they don't know how their students are feeling. There are three benefitile about this technology. The Facial Action Coding System help the teachers identify the emotion of their students. The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy.

The first reason is the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it help the teachers identify the emotion of their student. It said in the article ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Some of the students in the school won't talk about how they are feeling in the classroom, and some of them would be scared to ask question when they are confused. The new technology would help the teachers so much on how to find out if their students are understanding the works they did in the classroom.

The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Everybody in this world needs someone that could tell if they were happy or sad, so they would feel like someone is understanding them at lest. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". These are the great things Eckman has classified that can help us and make us smile.

The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy. Sometime we can tell that the person is happy or sad, but we can't not tell it all the time. We can makes the wrong assumption about a person by the look on their face.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. So we need the new technology to help telling us about a person feeling.        ",3
0cecb68,"Dear Senator,

I think the United States of America should change or abolish the Electoral College because sometimes it is not actually what the people want. In the 2000 Election Al Gore won the popular vote meaning more people in the USA wanted him at President than the winner. Should'nt we give the people what they want? A poll states thart over 60% of United States voters want to change or get rid of the Electoral College for this exact reason. The state sends people to represent the State not to represent the people. The state or people in office could totally defy whatever the people want in that state.

Lets say there is a tie. Then every state would have only 1 vote meaning the little state of Delaware would have as much say as the huge state of California. This example is the complete opposite of doing what the people want.This means the 35 million people have as much say as the 500,000 or sol in Delaware. Our government bases off what the people want but the Electoral College dosen't always base off what the people more than what the state wants itself.

Each party representing the state selects the ""trusted"" people for each state. What if those people have a change of heart and they decide to change towards something the state dosen't want. (Which is very possible) Then what would happen? Would either the Democrats or Republicans really be elected or would it just be 270 people in the room just be deciding whatever they want?

Sincerly,

0cf0f8e,"This technology is valuble to the the classroom in my opinion. I think that because it's good to calculate someone's feelings. The part that got me the most was when 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts, I feel that's a good idea because some students are afraid to ask for help in front of the class. They said

'the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face' which is also a good thng. "" Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion, but also may even help produce them' which is also good.

I feel like this would be great thing for science. You can do great, fun projects with this at school. You can use it with your friends. Knowing someones emotions without having to ask is a good thing. When feeling sad and nobody knows it but then technology comes and someone knows and they help you be happy again, or become friends. You can help people become more happy by knowing they're sad and make them smile. You can know what your friendis feelings or your boyfrind/girlfriend. Let's say you don't want to talk about how you're feeling so the technology helps you speak without having too.

We can have 'empathy' states the article so we might not have to explain ourselfs and explain how we are feeling about a certian soution. You won't have to keep your feelings inside forever. It's a good way to learn about science of emotions even said it in the article. I also think it's a good thing thing to have around kids/teens older people since technology is the furture. This how I feel about the Facial Action Coding System.",3

0cf9088,"Dear State Senator,

Sir I would like to point out the fact that the Electoral College is a flawed, outdated system that serves no real purpose in today's world, however it is beautifully American. When the Electoral College was first established it was because we wre a country divided, not in idealogy but physically. We wre a great nation that didn't have electronic voting, the Electoral College was an institution of the people by the people. The folks that were chosen to pick our next President could have been your neighbour or your doctor or even you, yourself. In today's modern, connected world it may seen unnecessay but this established intstutitution of voters voting for voters is still needed. If we switched directly to  a modern vote the wait times on a new POTUS would be unbelievable. Losers could claim fraud because of the electronic voting. Every election would now seem like the fiasco in 2000. It would make 2004 seem like a fair election and 1888 wouldn't even be remembered.

I do believe that the ""winner takes all"" system could be tweaked a little to catch up to modern time and that states like Maine and Nebraska are on to something. Minorities in bigger states such as Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas need a voice. An uneven number of votes is also needed to end the possibility of a tie. There needs to be more clear cut rules on what to do.

Ultimately Senator I do not believe that the total disbandment of the Electoral College is neccesary, a reform may be needed as technology progresses. Something that does need a total overhaul is Floridad's new Common Core and gratuation requirements.

Sincerly Yours,

The caption noted ""huge rock formation... which rembles a human head. fprmed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" (3)

If it is a driverless car shouldnt the driver not have to be alert? if the driver still has to be awear of all the suroundings then is there realy a point in having a car that drives its self, but can not preforn simple tasks like pulling in and out of a drive way (paragraph two).

Also lets take into acount how many people may think that its okay now that there are cars that drive their selfs that they can get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. What about a case where a person falls asleep because they are getting bored waiting on the car to tell them its their turn to drive.(paragraph Eight)

Some people will not wake up to alarm clocks let alone their car telling them that it needs help. Texting and driving no doubt will get worse the driver may think the car can handel it for one more text, but it couldnt.

With how the draving laws change are we going to have to spend more money to get our cars to download the new laws and even then will we really be safe? Will the driving age change now that knowing how to drive is not really needed?

Yes the cars have sensors and GPS and cameras but even people have missed seeing a Deer, Racoon, and in some cases even people. Also how is a car going to know the difference between a person daydreaming and one that is alert? What if the car notifies you too late that they dont know what they are doing?

0d0a0cb,"In 1976 a surveyor caught a absurd picture coming from the face of Mar's planet. By face, it was literally a face. NASA didn't know how to explain but with the explanation that it was a mesa or some other landfiorm on the surface. Is it or is it not? Many people think its aliens, but let's look at the big picture. There is pure evidence that what you're seeing is a landform and I have some examples.

After close survey of the "" face "" NASA has concluded that what we are seeing is a mesa. In the text it says, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa-landforms common in the American West."" That is proof that scientists who specialize in this wwork confirm that what we are looking at are just mesas or buttes.

But really if there was aliens on MArs then we would've seen some evidence by now. If aliens built this then why didn't we see any tracks or signs that the aliens built this thing. NASA has taken photographs of the moon and Mars many times. In those times if there was alien life then I would think that their would be some sort of sign that leads us to believe that we are not alone.

Everyone knows that the alien theory is just fun in games. People just let those kinds of pictures out mainly for the enjoyment of the people. In the text it says, "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" That shows that NASA just released this photo so that the people would have some entertainment theorizing what this is.

Another big piece of evidence was shown in this story. In the text it says, "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cyodnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Thats the sole cause. It was just a mesa that was photographed at the right time. If the shadows weren't there then it would just look like a regular mesa on Mar's surface. Also if you look in that picture you will see other mesas or landforms surrounding it. So that tells you that that area is full of landfroms.

In conclusion, there is so much evidence showing that this was just a landform. And if you still believe that thi is aliens then you need to look at the facts. Aliens might be real but we need to find evidence that they did this before we go and say that they did. Based on evidence we can conclude that this picture is of a mesa taken at the right time to where it looks like a face. ",4
0d0b940,"As the world develops and time goes forward, technology is advancing by the year. From cell phones to gaming devices, every piece of technology is getting better and better. One piece of technology is also getting better as years go on, and that is space techonolgy and transportation. NASA has created an idea to be able to live close to the hosstile conditions of Venus; in which, people would live on blimp-like vehicle over the planet itself. Venus's climate and terrain might be an issue to the growing pursuit that people and companies (like NASA) are making towards travilling to Venus. That's not to say that the study and travel towards the planet can have pros and cons.

The weather on Venus is more perilous than anything we could think about on Earth. In paragraph 3 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" With the facts of how dangerous it is on Venus, it is insane to think of anyone who would want to travel to and study the planet of Venus.

On the other hand, NASA and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" think the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph 4 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.."" While the conditions of our neighboring planet, Venus, seem to outweigh the history of the symetry that our planets once were; exploration and the study of Venus might be a worthwhile cause.

Even without the traveling to Venus, companies and astrologist can still learn a great deal about the atmosphere of Venus without putting their lives at risk. In the concluding paragraph of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus,"" the author breifly talks about how studying the planet of Venus can benefit the intellingence of our world. The author states in paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author's opinion in the article could possibly be spot-on. With the challenges of trying to gain access to Venus's surface, the United States, as well as several other countries, have expanded their technological advances.

With everything being said and done, exploration and the studying of Venus has major pros and cons. The pros being that with the challenge of Venus's surface, technology has advance to the point where one day, humans may be able to travel to the hostile planet. the cons of course being the temperature, pressure, terrain, and atmospher of the planet we are so desperately trying to travel to. Travel should not just be expanded to neighboring planets; with the topic of space travel being more popular than ever, human can start the new era of space travel.",4
0d125d4,"The big debate is wether we should use automated cars that are operated without a use of a driver controling it. I believe that this may be the way to create driving easier and safer for everyone. Driverless cars are going to be a great thing if the big companies like Google and General Motors keep developing this concept of a car drving on its own.

The whole idea of having a car drive on its own just seems like a dream. Well in today's world we already have driverless cars in use in states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. I believe that this is a big long term plan. It isn't just going to change in a year or two, this process in going to take time to develop. In today's world there are car wrecks that happen every single day, but what if we could stop the amount of wrecks with automated cars that sense danger and bring down the percent of wrecks a day. If we would be able to do this, it would make it safer to be on the roads and the streets not having to worry about other cars crashing into you.

Now there are a lot of people that are highly against this idea. They believe that it will take to long. That we should trust our instincts while driving. Another thing is this process would have to be allowed by the law and government. I have to argue that this going to take a long time to covert everything for automated cars, and yes it will be expensive for the starting years. Think about it long term, everyday we use up natural rescources of our planet. Scienctists say that there are only so many natural resources and that we need to start conserving these resources. Cars fill up for gas everyday and use up these resources. Google's Cofounder Sergey Brin envisions that these automated cars will use half the fuel of regular cars today. That is a big difference and it will save us in the long run.These car can keep a safer environment for people. The human's can't rely on one another while driving. Too many people die every year in car crashes because someone was drinking too much or had some impairment while driving. Just think, the automated cars can't get drunk and swerve into another car.

When this discussion comes up later in life remember this. These cars can hold the key for more resources in the future, and make it safe to be on the roads again. Be on the side of this argument that can make a difference in today's world and society.",4
0d18ff3,"Technology can be beneficial in several aspects of everyday life, but reading emotions should not be one of them. According to the article, the technology to read human emotions is possible and can be effiecently used to detect how a person is feeling. This technology is certainly impressive but does not seem very beneficial to the average student and can be seen as slightly intrusive. Therefore, this technology would not be valuable in a classroom due to the small amount of benefit that it would provide and its intrusiveness, as students should have a right to keep certain emotions and feelings to themselves.

It seems unnecessary to use this technology when emotions are already fairly easy to identify without the use of a computer. Body language and facial expressions can already easily be analyzed by humans themselves to reveal emotions. To quote the writer of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto 5). This depicts that technology is not required to identify the basic emotions of a human being and is therefore unnecessary.

If a person is not blatantly showing his emotions with body language and facial expressions, then the person wold likely prefer not to express what he is feeling or thinking. All human beings have a natural right to keep their thoughts and emotions to themselves as they please, and technology that can reveal emotions at their deepest depths can be intrusive. An example of this can be how computers use cookies to track what people are searching on the Internet in order to produce advertisements directed toward the user later on, which often disturbs people and makes them feel uncomfortable. This may be the same situation if computers have access to human emotions. The private feelings of a human should not be exploited by a computer, and therefore trespasses a basic right of humans which allows them to have their own private thoughts and emotions.

The final reason that this technology would not be valuable is because there are little uses for it. Detecting emotions are not really relevant when using a computer. The author of the article states many examples of how this technology can be used on a computer, and the use of using the emotions to determine the type of advertisements would match emotions and what the user is feeling does not seem very important or beneficial. Overall, the implementation of technology into a student's everyday life would not be useful, therefore making it seem pointless rather than valuable.

Therefore, the idea of implementing technology that read emotions would not be valuable in a typical classroom. Despite the consistency of the technology working successful, it would be worthless to bring into everyday lives as people do not need advanced computers to identify other people's emotions. The technology would also be extremely intrusive, as it would exploit the private thoughts and emotions of people that would not want their emotions to be detected and make them feel slightly uncomfortable. Alongside these reasons, there is practically no use for this advanced technology in a typical day of an ordinary student. For these reasons, while the concept of reading emotions may be interesting, there is not much benefit that will come from the use of this technology and therefore implementing it into classrooms would be a prodigious waste of money and effort in order to provide a minimal benefit for students.

0d190c0,"The author gives good reasons on why we should explore Venus. He/she describes the environmental hazards of the planet in order to explain to us on how NASA can explore and research it more. The author gives reasons on why we should take the risk to explore Venus such as it being closest to Earth, has potential for an earth-like atmoshphere, and can be a good use of planetary visit in the future.

According to the article, Venus is the the closest planet to earth after Mars; but that is depending on where we are when orbiting around the solar system. ""Often referred to as Earths twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too""(Venus 2). This part of the article is what describes the fact that it is similar to Earth. The planet is our neighbor, which makes it easier so that we wouldn't have to use tons of time, energy, and money on something that is too many light years away.

The author gives info on how Venus may have some Earth-like features which would be good so that we can use it as a secondary planet if something goes horribly wrong with Earth somehow. Venus has been reported to have similar structures such as valleys, mountains, craters, and even potential ocean life. The planet even has weather and similar natural disasters like Earth such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and even lightning stikes. ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Venus 3). These are just some of the reasons the author gives on what potential Venus could have.

Finally, the author thinks that Venus would be a good backup planet to Earth, but it would be difficult to claim the land as ours and so that we could live there without any type of circumstances. The author also gives reasons on why it would be difficult to explore and find a way to live on this planet. But, it would give NASA a challenge on figuring out on what type of innovations they can make up. The author says on paragraph 5,""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way""(Venus 5). These reasons alone can convince the reader that exploring and studying this planet would be worth the hard work and effort put into the inventions. The author could have given some reasons on why another planet to live would be worth THAT much work, but they did a good job otherwise.

The author has given good reasons and claims that made his or her's article convcing for the most part. They had evidence that can convince us and give us high hopes on what NASA could benifit from. The author wants us to explore Venus because it is closest to Earth, has potential for an earth-like atmoshphere, and can be a good use of planetary visit in the future. ",4

It is also going to make it easier during assignments on the ones struggling. So i beleive that the introduction to the teachers with this technology could be very useful around many schools.

0d2070c,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is speculated to have been the most similar to Earth, studying it can be done at reasonable expectations, and combatting the difficulty of studying Venus will have great benefits to our knowledge on the planet itself and space exploration.

It has long been a conspiracy yet to be proven as to if Venus is one of our known sister planets that are the most similar to Earth today. Space explorers long ago predicted that Venus was likely covered with large oceans and had the potential to possibly support multiple forms of life. Without an indepth study of Venus at a close and personal view, nothing can be predetermed factually. In paragraph four the author explains that ""it [Venus] may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that the possibility is there but without extra measures taken to pursue an indepth study, the question remains unanswered as to if Venus is a sister planet of Earth.

While an upclose, indepth view of Venus is not predictable due to the harsh environment, NASA has found potential ways to make exploration dueable to an extent. In paragraph five, the author states that: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This helps widen the idea that exploration of Venus can be done and met at a reasonable expectation and limit safe for explorers. The author proceeds to state that while the conditions are not particularly easy they are ""survivable for humans."" This helps detail and push for the idea of the exploration of Venus because it is and has been discovered that the study can be done safely.

The overall study of Venus can prove to be extremely beneficial to our knowledge on the planet alone, and our knowledge on space exploration at most. In paragraph eight, it is stated that ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" In which it does, combatting the challenge of Venus proves to be tough, but if done, it can mean more to the exploration of other planets that are tougher than Venus alone. Further in paragraph eight, it is said that ""travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Once we begin to limit our exploration and discoveries due to the dangers and doubts, we take away from our progression of knowing what is out of our way. With the study of Venus we can extend our doings to meet every innovation and curiosity about our solar system all together.

Studying Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. With the study of Venus we can determine if Venus is a sister planet of our planet today, and if the planet was once inhabitable for organisms and humans. Studying Venus is also worth the pursuit because the study can be done, and if the study is done, it will benefit us far more than the study of any other planet has yet to. The study of Venus will bring our knowledge and our future immense benefits in all aspects.    ",6

I do believe cars cause a huge disavantage to our clean air but i do not agree with banning people from driving gassed cars, But It would be better for the environment if people would start buying electric cars (hybrid) because some dont run off of gas and some use very little gas. Using these electric cars will benifit everyone because it cost less instead of buying gas and it leaves cleaner air in our environment. Even if lets say forty percent of United States citizens used electric cars that would still leave a huge roll in having cleaner air for us to breath, But if we all do switch to electric cars then cities need to provide cargers for cars like this so that if we are out for a while and our cars battery dies we can charge the car, I think people dont use these cars as much because they think well what happenes if my cars battery dies then there screwed.

0d28420,"Twenty Five years ago, something oddly strange happend on Mars. The NASA spacecraft, Viking 1 had caught a photo on the red planet that had a very strong identical look to a human face. Many scientist thought it was the work of aliens but here are some facts to prove that this theory is incorrect. Through the process of movie films, books and other things people used to explain this phenonmean, and through scientifical evidence.

When the news spread about the strange human face on Mars, many people became interested in the fact that aliens could have been responsibel for this event. To surpise the face on Mars has become a popular icon, with many Hollywoodfilms, books, magazines, and even talk shows. This greatly increased the number people going with the idea that aliens could be the cause of this but this idea is false. In the atricle ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it talks about on April 5,1998 that the Mars Global Surveyor was launched over Mars to check the so called alien monument. While using the Mars Orbiter Camera, Micheal Malin and his crew used his ten time sharp vision to scan the ""alien monument"" and found out it was just a natural lanform.

Even though the scince had proved that the strange face on Mars was just a landform, not alot of people were convinced. However, Science once agian came out to prove once and for all that it was indeed a landform. Using the camera again, Michael Malin and his crew caluclated the picture of the landform while using maximum resoltion and their result was amazing. The photo on Mars and a photo on earth had proved that the Mars face was just a butte or mesa landform. Infact, these are common in the American West!

There will always be arugements around the world, but these facts prove that the Mars Face is just a landform. All the movies, books, and magizines can be be true and interesting to belive, but the science in it all proves that this whole ""alien monument"" and that Mars has a face, is all far-fetched.

0d2ca3c,"Today i will be disscusing the the different aspects about driverless cars. In the first paragraph I will be talking specifically about the postive aspects of driverless cars. In paragraph two im going talk about the negative effects on the situation. For our third body paragrapgh i'll be introducing the

Cofounder Sergey Brin says that he foresees that we'd use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility then a bus. In 2013, BMW announced that these driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020! The cars that Google has had since 2009 have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. They alert drivers when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

One negative question I have for these driverless cars is, ""Whats the point of having these cars if you still need a driver""? New laws will be needed in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident. ""If technology fails and someone gets injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer? This requires human skills which means humans have to be alert at all time in case of emergency. These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads.

""In 1980's automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. These sensors are in need of improvements so that these driverless cars can be capable to handle more of the driving task that can lead to dangerous accidents. The 1980 cars had become more advanced to detect respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. IN the end these cars just need a lot of sensors so they can sense when things are about to occur.

Today i've talked about three different preview points. In the first body paragraph I talked about the positive upside of the driverless cars. In the second paragraph I had a dicussion about negative effects on driverless cars. With my third body paragraph I ended with talking about smarter cars and their sensors. I really hope you've enjoyed the conversation about these so called driverless cars coming in the future!      ",1

One day his frend Don asked him do u want to go on a Europe cattle boat with me. Luke said yes because he thught it would been a nice thing to do. After that Luke and Don seen that the UNRRA were looking for Seagoing Cowboys to help out with animals that were are shipped overseas. So Luke and Don signed up, they knew it wouldn't hurt to try something new.

Trips, yes trips Luke went to several places he went to Europe and China. Also, went to Venice and got to ride the gondola ride he even seen a castle in Crete he thought it was beautuful. Ah forget he went to Panama Canal too, well I dont know what that is but seems intresting though.

Seagoing Cowboy, it was alot of work but it turned out really fun. Luke said it was more then a adventure. A opportunity to try something new and helping other and spending the with new friends. Saying yes was good after all.

So i hope you liked it how Luke had a awesome time. Thinking it wouldn't be good after graduation but well it did. So thank you for reading hope it put intrest on your face.      ",1
0d3ae64,"Some people think that the face on mars was created by aliens. This essay will tell you that the face is just another one of Mars mesa or butte.

The face on mars was not created by aliens because there is no life on mars. The face looked like an alien artifact because the images were not sharp so you can't see that the face was just equivalent to a butte or mesa.

The face was just equivalent to a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The face looked like an alien artifact because it was a huge rock formation.

The face is a huge rock which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth. The face is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.

The scientists concluded that the face was not created by aliens. The face was just another one of Mars natural landforms.",2
0d3b8e3,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" introduces the idea that driverless cars are almost ready. My argument of driverless cars is, are they ready? Who is to blame if an accident happens? The manufacturer or the owner? Which the narrator also asks, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" The premise of my argument, is that the driver, should in no way be the one at fault. Unless they themselves wreck the car.

Driverless cars are a very unique sort of car. For one, they do not need a driver. In most cases, that is. Driverless cars have one factor that many car companies are working on: they also need a driver. Which makes them half driverless and half driver... full? BMW driverless cars can only go to about 25 mph (miles per hour), ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,""

before needing assitance by the driver behind a wheel. GM has driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, ""...driver's seats that vibrate..."" Also, the Google car just says whenever the person is required to take over. ""...simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.""

What if a special needs/ disabled person uses one of these cars? Are the manufacturers going to blame them for not being able to use their own hands and feet on the vehicle? This is another scary thing that could very well happen in the future. At least a person without some kind of disability would have control of the car if the autopilot did indeed fail. My counter-argument to my argument would be that there are plenty of sensors around the car stated in paragraph 4, ""...they needed a whole lot of sensors,"" but, what if the senors failed? What if every single sensor failed and someone was incapable of controlling the car? Who is responsible?

My argument is not one that can be answered right now. It is just a question that many could use an answer from. The well-being and capability of the car is an important aspect of said car. Many bad accidents could happen and whether or not the accident is pinned on the car maker or the car driver is to be disputed.",3
0d57890,"The idea of a world where no one would buy a car because no one would need one sounds silly, but it could very well be the way of the future. New things are developing each day and more people are jumping on board with the world of technology. The idea of a driverless car forming a public transportation system is one of the biggest ideas in the technology industry. Being able to create a system of transportation that would elimate the use of other cars is a big step in society and the world we live in today.

There are many ups and downs to this idea of a driverless car. On the positive side of this idea there would be less pollution in the air and people who have disabilities could get to and from places more easily. But, with these good things also come some negative aspects. The cost of transportation would probably go up, even though the car is driverless there would still probably be a fee to the transportation just like a taxi service. Even though the car would have been tested to make sure it can drive with out wrecking there would still be the fear the car would wreck for the passengers aboard the car so it probably wouldnt be that great of an expierence. Also, the teenagers of the world would be giving up the freedom they have waited there whole life to be able to do, if the world souly depended on the driverless car and no one would buy cars anymore teenagers would not have to oppertunity to drive like they have always wanted.

Even with the new technology of this driverless car there would still be people who would not be on board with it. What about those people? Would they still be able to buy themselves a new car? Or would manufacturers stop selling them altogether and just start making different models of the driverless car. For now in our world it is better to stick with technology we have and wait to introduce a newer and unfamilar form of technology.",3
0d5876f,"Living on a different planet would be something amazing. Getting to see new enviorments and see new things. That may be why scientist are trying to study Venus. Venus is filled with things that show that it once was livable. Some even say that it can be the Earths twin beacuse of the similiarites they have. But it's also very difficult to be able to study Venus because of conditions that make it use impossible to be there.Which can be a major setback for people. But if they succeed it can be a big deal here's why.

Venus shows many similarities to Earth. Some people even consider them to be twin planets. We know this because according to the article on paragraph 2 it states"" Often referred to as Earth's "" twin"". Venus is the closest plant to Earth I terms of denisty and size. This shows us that their just consider as twins but they also show similiar size and density. Which concludes why they are consider twins because of their size.

This also shows many more similar things to Earth such as what it has on the planet. Eath has valleys,oceans,moutains, and craters. Well Venus is considerd to have these millions of years ago. We can confirm this because from the text on paragraph 4 it states ""Venus still has soe featyres that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains and craters. From this information we can pick out some key simliarties that show that Venus once had these things that Earth also has.

Once NASA found out about these things on Venus they wanted to explore the planet. So NASA decided to launch nurmerous spacecraft to Venus once the plant would get closer to Earth. But each spacecraft was unmanned, we know this because if look back into the text you can see in paragraph 2 it states"" Each pervious mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" From that we can pick out to thing. NASA have tried to land multiple aircrafts on the planet and that the plant was impossible to land on.

The reason the planet was impossible to land on was because the planet 800 degrees. Which made very difficult to land on. We know this is true beacuse accorinding the passage it states "" On the planet's surface, temperatures averager over 800 degrees Fahrebheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. From this information we can see how it is very challenging for NASA to land on Venus.

In conclusion I think studying Venus can be worth it beacuse it shows great potential.It also shows lots of possibilities for human life to be on it. Just beacuse of the extreme weather conditions doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to explore it. It can lead to another world that we can discover. This is why I think we should study Venus .           ",3
0d5a937,"Robot cars or driverless cars should not be developed. The development of thes cars can lead to many negative influences. Such as lacking or lazieness, wrecks, a lot of money and could be hacked. Driverless cars to many people is a thumbs down.

There are many different things that the humans just phiscally need to do and driving is one of them. The development of cars that can get you from point a to point b is already good enough. Most teenagers and adults like the thought of them being able to drive phsically and mentally. It would get boring after awhile because you would just be sittting there the whole entire time not incontrol of anything. There has been way to many technology objects that has been created which has been proven to make the human generation lazy. Creating safer transportation is positive and should be the direction cars should be leading towards. Driverless car may sound a little cool, but could lead to many dangerous harm.

The dangers of a car driving itself isn't so safe. There could be many malfuntions that could create car crashes. Many malfuntions could happen such as not braking in time, string uncontrolably, elctrical explosions, or maye even if the car accelerates when it's not needed. Teenagers could sitting in one on the road texting and not paying attention while the vechile is heading towards a tree or a person. The danger zones of driving will rise even more. Technology with other minor things is already expensive, hard telling how much these cars would cost.

Cars already are very expensive to buy now, so what could make these cars easy to produce and sell? People just need to learn how to drive and enjoy it. the safty of the driverless cars isn't asured to the public and can make tragities. With all the new technology what couldn't stop a hacker hacking into your cars computer base. And then you have automakes and driver problems in who would accident fault would be on. this driverless car inventing process should just be stopped.",4
0d5afc5,"Over twenty-five years ago a face was spotted that looked almost like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but was soon found out that this was just another mesa in the Cydonia region. Once this was seen by alien theortists though, they really believe it was made by aliens, but here's my reasoning why they are wrong.

When the Face was first spotted by NASA's Viking 1 spaceship, in 1976, the scientists in the Jet Propulsion Lab were amazed by what they saw. Though it was only a little while when the scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, but the shadows around it gave it the illustion of a face. Once this was released to the public not my people believe it was a mesa. The alien theortists said, ""The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" Even when the defenders of NASA said, ""Wish there was an ancient civilzation on Mars."" This still did not make the alien theortists want back down.

Years later, in 1998, Michael Malin photographed the Face with his Mar Orbiter Camera. This picture was ten times sharper than the Viking photos years before. Soon thousands of people were waiting for the Face to appear, but when it did, it was shown to be a natural landform, no alien formation. Even when shown this, many alien theortists said that the clouds were blocking the alien markings.

In 2001, Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of the Face. There is no excuses on whether or not this is a mesa or an alien formation. The sky was clear, the picture was 1.56 meters per pixel, than the Viking fourty-three meters per pixel. There is not argument that this a natural landform. Even if there was something as big as the Egyptian pyramids or as small as a shack, you whould be able to tell what it was in a picture like this. After that picture was taken Jim Garvin said,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" also, he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated measa about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.""

This is proof on whether or not the Face is a natural landform. After the first sighting in 1976 to the lastes picture taken in 2001, the Face on Mars is clearly a natural landform, not a alien formation. ",3
0d64085,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and his friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowboy. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy. Luke showed that he wanted to help others and animals as he would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I think he liked China as the best tour that he probably been on before, because he talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that he had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowboy that was showed in the passage. And he loves that he is doing in the passage i think, he likes caring for other animals that were in the passage that it was stated in the passage.      ",2
0d66b05,"Ever wanted to go live on a diffrent planet Scientist feel as though Venus conditons are good enough for people to soon be occupiants on the planet,but according to the passage they have alongway to go in way of technology and traportation and the controlloing of the harsh conditions

In the beginning,the author states that "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth"". The passage also states that ""Astronomers are fasinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system"". It is evident that the author is trying to suggest that studying venus is a worthy persuit despite the dsangers it presents because scientists and NASA want to try to find a way on the planet without touching it dangerous ground. NASA has come of with an ""idea"" as such as having hovering cars or a ""blimp-like' vehicle hovering over venus for closer obsevations. And many scientists have said if they could could get the temputure to around 170 degress fahrenheit the it would be survivble for humans.

In addition f the author feel as though the scientists should not continue to do these expiriments or the test visits because of all the dangers and the safety risks of trying to get inform on Venus. According to the passage, the temputure can get to a high of 800 Degrees or More!, and the atmosphere has a 97% blankets of cabon dioxide covering it. Also, the"" atmosperic pressure is about 90times greater than what we expirence on Earth"". The passage states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than what we are used to"".

The article also decribes Venus as ""closet to the sun"" which is another good reason why not to keep exploring because the harshness of the weathe and the harsh stoms and weather that venus expirence.

In Conclusion, Scientists and NASA and other organizations who are trying to come into contact or reach venus should not bceause of weather conditions and condtions that arent meant for humans. Not only are the condtions bad but the atmosphre is,Including the 97% Carbon dioxide blackets covering Venus. Also the passage states that,""NASA is still work on a new and more efficent way to reach venus such as a ""electronis made of silicon caride chamber"". And another plan is to rewind bac k in time to use a stategie called ""mechanicle computers"" used In the 1800s.

0d67d1f,"1976 Nasa took a photo of a landfill that looked like a human face. Later on though they discovered that the face was just a martian mesa, and that the shadows helped the mesa look like a face. It is not evidence to life on mars because , Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia, And on April 5th 1998 the surveyer took another picture of the face on mars, and the image was much more clearer and they could see that it was just a landform nothing more.

Martian mesa's are very common and can be found through out Mars. The only thing that helped it look like a face was, the shadows that the mesa made. The sun also cause the mesa to look like a face but when nasa took a closer and clearer photo of the mesa they found out it was just a simple rock formation that had very dark shadows making it to look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth as the text states.

You see al it was just a landform there was no alien sculpture or anything like that, even though that would have been cool it just didn't happen. But thats okay because we learned new things about Mars and about space. But in the end we all learned something new. ",3

Venus is dangerous to study but also very cool at the same time. The author suggest that venus is worthy to be studied despite the dangers because venus is very challenging, and non-normal

The author suggest that venus is worthy of studying because it's challenging. Venus is the most second closest to the sun behind mercry and infront of earth ""it has proven a very challenging place to examine more closely"" in this quote from the article basically states that Venus can be very different to examine up closely thus making it hard for people to study venus.

The author also suggest that venus is worthy of studying because it's non-normal. ""Venus can also be called ""Evening Star"" is the brightest points of light in night sky"" this quote from the article tells us that Venus has the brighest light that no other planet has. On Venus it's 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater then on earth that's not for a normal planet for it to be 800 degrees that's bruning hot.

Venus isn't like any other planet with high tempertures, erupting valcanoes, and etc. Now if you had a chance to study Venus would you dangerous or not Venus sounds really cool to look into for reserch. Venus is a very cool planet with the brightest light in the sky.               ",3

If i have to put my child's life into someone elses hands it would not be a computer. Now I am not saying the machine can not do it's job. I am siply saying in my opinion there are to many things that could go wrong.

Someone could hack it for instence. They could run the vehicle of the road, or ey sencers could nowfunction. Say you are going down the road and a little kid runs out infront of you. In a regular car in i can brerak every time, but in a driverless car if the fuse is bad or a wire is loose it may not tivate the breaking system, becuase the sencer was not working. Now imagion for me if you will that kid that ran out in the road was your own child. Young and inocennt with so much life before him/her.

0d8bfc5,"The driverless cars could help us to drive safely and more comfotably in the thought meanwhile, we also have to think about how are the driverless cars could affect us in real life.

First, if we allow the driverless cars in the real life then we have to make new laws for new things. As paraghraph says ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers passengers, and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety is the best achieved with alert drivers."" also if driverless car killed the person then how are we going to punish the driverless cars even it wasn't kill person. and the driverless car didn't navagated well so the driverless car against the law by the watching the stop sign. then the car have to get a penalty who would have to get a penalty since the car was driverless car. many people still think about few more laws before they prefer to having driverless car only for comfotableness.

The lastly the driverless car won't be able to navigate the car well even though the driverless cars are actually based on the computer. if the human drives the car then he will knows the way well such as the highway and just street. and if on the road and road has the traffic the human driver car will be passed by that way or find diffrent way to go to the destination but, if the driverless car drives toward to the that way then the people who's taking that car will stuck at the traffic and wait until the traffic will over.

0d91c5e,"While the idea of having a fully-autonomous is very real, scientists are still very far from it. Research is being conducted every day to improve the efficeincy and safefty of these new semi-autonomous vehicles. In my opinion, driverless cars are inevitable and I would not doubt that I will end up seeing one in my lifetime. But as of right now, cars can't do as much as scientists are hoping for in the future. With that being said, I will there will be a more positive outcome of driverless cars than negative.

Many skeptics say dirverless cars will never be possible. But, what they don't realize is that we are closer than we ever have been before regardless of how much research is still necessary to succesfully make a fully autonomous car. Google's concept car has been able to drive over half a million miles without a crash. Their car still requires a driver, but it is only for more advanced tasks such as traffic issues or roadwork. Other companies have also attempted to create a driverless concept car and the concepts have showed potential. They are far from driverless but they are going in the right direction. BMW announced that their car could handle driving speeds of up 25 mph but still require the focus of a human being behind the wheel.

While I am very supportive of driverless cars, I think there will always be flaws, no matter the size. I think there will always be malfunctions but that does not mean that those can be fixed either. The research that has been put into these vehicles have been very strenuous and have proven that there will never not be flaws in creating an autonomous car. They still may crash but the probability of a fatal crash in a driverless is much lower than the probability of a fatal crash due to human error. Humans get distracted thus creating more chances for an accident to occur. With driverless cars, there is no chance of human error or the car getting distracted because driving is what it was built for.

There are not many current laws or regulations on autonomous cars, so even if Google or BMW were to finish research and create a flawless and driverless car, they wouldn't be able to manufacture them on a commercial level. This is because there wouldn't be any laws covering liability in the case of an accident, if an accident were to somehow occur. It is undetermined who would be at fault for the accident according to the state. I think the company should be more at fault, considering they are advertising these cars as ""driverless"".

With my opinion on driverless cars being said, I still think they are a good idea and will benefit society in the long run and keep more people safe. There are bumps in the road regarding laws and the time it will take to get to where big name companies want to be. But, if we are all patient and let scientists conduct quality research, I see a bright future for fully autonomous cars.",3

How safe is the driverless car going to be ? Is the car going to help you stay safe at all times? People have gotten really close to making car to where it doesn't need a drive to drive it.

Driverless cars may sound cool but are they really useful? In the text it states that "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents""(7). The car can only do so much without a human having to come in and take over. The car has certain features that it can do all by itself but it is always going to need a human to do most of the task. I do not feel like the cars should be made to drive themselves. If an accident were to happen there would be no one to put the blame on because you have a car that can drive itself but then you have a driver in the driver seat. In the text it specifically states "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver or manufacturer?(9).Since there is no one to put the blame on the person is just going to be injured and is not going to know how they are going to make it if no one is responslibe for the accident.

In conclusion the driverless cars should not be made because they aren't really useful. In the text it says "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?""(8). If the car can't drive itself there is no point of the car being made. If its called a ""Driverless"" car then why does it need a driver when accidents are near or while they are driving through work zones? The cars would just honestly waste everyone's time because they are not what they say they are. In the text it also states "" This means the human driver must be alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs""(7).

A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car.

A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg."" The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.

Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane.

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week."" American now is has fewer car sales, people driving less, and there are fewer and fewer liscences each year. Americas love of motor vehicles seems to be subsiding. People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike.

The age of the car may be coming to an end. Communities have started promoting a car free life style. Made othe ways of transportation avaliable. The younger people in the community have quit driving all together. Wether becuase it is good for the enviorment or a choice they had to make becuase of the city they live in. Transpotation is evolving into a public affair, not a personal one. The automotive industry may take a hit but in the long run this could be beneficial for our planet. There will always be car buffs, but sooner rather then later, you may not own a car altogether.                    ",2

The amazing things we do have really inspired me to really show people the real me and you can too!

In 1945 World War ll was over in Europe. Unfortinatly many countries were left in ruins. Of course we had to do something about it. We were asked to take care of the hourses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Of course we did! it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and one month to get to China. We had a lot of free time exploring the world and trying new things. I found new ways to have fun once we unloaded the animals. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals were housed. Whittling, reading, fencing, boxing, tennis tournaments, and games also helped time go faster. It was a great opportunity for me and my friends to learn more about the things that surrond us. Our journey to Italy was wonderful! Seeing the Acropolis was special, so was taking a gondola ride in Venice.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Awareness stayed with Luke Bomberger. He led his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. I would love to be apart of such a wonderful program!    ",3
0da206f,"Electoral Congress

Have you ever wondered how the government adds up the votes and determinds who the president is after the election? the Electoral College is a process made in the Constitution, a compromise between the election by Congress and the election by citizens. Most would say that the Electoral College is reguarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic way of selecting a president. Like every other thing in the world, people form their own opinions. There are pros and cons to everything, even the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College is exactly what it sounds like. It is a group of highly educated people that come together every year during the presidental election and choose wisely who the want to become president and vice president. Once everyone is complete choosing who they select, they add them up and seperate them by each state. Keep in mind, each state only gets a certain number of electors, depending on how big the state is. For example, Florida, the state that I live in, gets 29 electoral votes, as to Hawii, which only gets four votes.

Next, the Electoral College has its pros and cons. One con of the College is they have more of an impact on the choosing of the president than the actual citizens have. You would think that the people, including both sides of the political parties, would have more of a say on whome becomes the president for the next four to eight years. For instance, multiple people and groups such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commence, And the AFL-CIO have said and agreed on, ""Abolishing the electoral college!"".

Lastly, we have many reasons why we keep the Electoral College. One reason is certainty of outcome, a president can have more citizen votes than the other, but the losing candidate can still win because of the electoral votes. Another reason this happens is because most states have a winner-take-all basis, meaning that the state chooses and the winning person with the most votes gets a state vote, even if you personally didn't vote for that person. Another reason why is because the U.S. has many larger states and the Electoral College balances it out for them.

So as you see, the Electoral College is debatable on whether or not it is a good or bad thing. They have pros and cons like everything else in the world.             ",2
0da2967,"Have you ever thought of having a car that could drive itself? It would be a pretty cool car to have but there are some things you have to think about when you consider on buying a car. Of course the car is going to be expansive but what car isnt? There are alot more negative things you have to think about when buying a smart car. Negative aspects of a driveless are is that they are expensive, need many sensors, and they result in many accidents.

A driveless car is very expansive because they have to know the roads, when to stop, how to stop, or when to go. It stated "" These smart-road-systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Driveless cars work well but they are too expensive because they have to know the upgrades of roads. Imagine the cost you have to pay for the car, giving them their money back for the money they spent and work they spent putting into the car. Sensors are a very big issues too in driveless cars.

Driveless cars require many sensors in order for the car to work and drive on its own. It seems cool but what will happen when one of those sensors stopped working and you didnt know? The sensors were placed every where in the car so therefore it can work properly. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor..."" There is a lot of sensors installed inside the car but something can go very wrong if one of them stop working and the car crashes and injure somebody.

Who fault would it be if someone is injured because of techonlogy failure ? Driveless car are not reliable due to safety concerns. ""Manucatures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe... If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If someone is hurt because the technology of the car, you really can't say who to blame. Although the driver can take control of the car at any time so therfore the driver can be at fault because the driver wasn't paying attention to the road. The driveless car is supposed to make the driver aware of danger but it couldn't have if there was an accident so the car can be at fault to. No one really Knows who to blame because both the car and the driver took responsible of the accident and they both could have prevented the accident from happening. If the car would have alerted the driver, the driver could have took control BUT if the driver eas paying attention, he could have once again took control.

There are positive and negative aspects when it comes to driveless cars but of course no one pays attention to the negative. When thinking about purchasing a driveless car you have to think about the cost and your safety concerns. Driveless cars are very expensive because of the sensors that are installed and the upgrades to road. They are dangerous becuase due to technology failure they can result into car accidents. Expence, sensors, and accidents are negative aspect of driveless ares.",4
0da50b1,"Driverless cars would be an amazing new technology to introduce to the world. The ability to simply call a taxi and have a driverless car pick you up and take you wherever you wish, whenever you wish will revolutionize the way people get around. The technology may be in its primitive stages as of now, but soon driverless cars can help to automate many tasks that are currently being done by humans. Driverless cars will be an excellent addition to the modern world.

Not only does the driverless car make sense practically, it also has many safety benefits. If all cars on the road are driverless, they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents, unlike with human drivers who can only control the car so well. The automated cars will be directly linked to brake systems, so if there is a need to brake, the car is hydroplanning, or another emergency is occuring, the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out by applying specific amounts of brake to each tire, as explained in section 5 of the story. Another safety measure taken with driverless cars is the ability for a human to take over. Google's driverless car will notify its passengers if they need to take over the wheel, as explained in section 7 because the task on the road is too difficult for the car to perform. Assurance of the ability for a human to still control the car is very important, since even though the computer systems onboard the car may be very smart, humans have the ability to judge most situations better than any computer can.

One counterargument to driverless cars is the loss of jobs. This is not stated in the article, but it would be an issue with driverless cars regardless. Many people working as taxi drivers, trash truck drivers, freight truck drivers, or any job involving driving can lose their jobs. This is a problem, especially in the US where there is already a shortage of jobs. Although driverless cars will bring many benefits, the cons of them have to be talked about as well.

Driverless cars are a scary prospect. The thought of a car driving itself can make many people uneasy. If done correctly, however, driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work. With companies such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan planning to have fully automated and driverless cars on the road and ready to go by 2020, driverless cars are just that much closer to becoming a reality. Driverless cars would make an excellent addition to the modern world.",4
0da70c3,"There are several ways the author suggests studying venus is a worthy pursuit desite dangers along the way. Some examples of these are, how close Venus is from the sun and how it is very similar to Earth. Also Venus may have had forms of life on it. The author gives examples for each one of these claims and how they would give a positive effect. These are just a few reasons we should explore Venus and figure out more about it.

The first reason to learn more about Venus is how close it is from the sun. One example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the second planet from our sun."" Which means that it is not very far away from earth. Another reason to study Venus is how similar it is to earth. An example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size."" A final reason is that Venus may of had forms of life on it. Evidence for this statement is shown when the text states,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This statement shows how Venus could have been very, very similar to earth.

In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.",3
0dabca9,"I claim that the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of the many reasons in the text he tells us. He says that it is very simple to see from a safe distance, but harder when you get closer to it, he also presents the idea that each mission was unmanned and for a good reason, and lastly Venus has a very thick atmosphere of a poisonious gas. These are all reasons he supports the idea that it is fun to study, but also dangerous. I will get more in depth with these reasons.

The first reason that the author supports this idea is when he says this statement in paragraph one, ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" This shows that the author is trying to support the idea because he is saying Venus is easy to see from Earth, and a far distance, but when our space programs have tried to get closer, it has presented more problems that make it very difficult to examine more closely, which shows the author says Venus is worth studying, but dangerous.

The second reason the author supports the idea is in paragraph two. He says ""Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This shows when the author says ""For a good reason"" that he is trying to say he supports the idea of us trying to study more about Venus, but is glad we are approaching it at a safe distance, and unmanned. This is another reason he is telling us that it is good to study, but dangerous.

The last reason the author supports this idea is in paragraph three when he states, ""Even more challenging are the clouds of the highly corrrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This shows that he is stating some of the facts that it is highly dangerous to go on Venus, by saying the words ""Even more challenging"" which presents he agrees with the idea that Venus is worthy to pursue studying, despite the dangers.

In conclusion, the reasons the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is because of the highly dangerous atmosphere, the spaceships that never survive landings on Venus for more than a few hours, and safe to see from a good vantage point but challenging when you get closer, all suggest that the author supports this idea. These are all reason as to how well the author does on being able to agree with this topic.                    ",3
0db7e99,"Being in a classroom with a large amount of students can be intimidating. This makes it easier for a student to fall behind in a classroom setting, since they may be too scared to ask a question. One may be thinking, ¨what if they laugh at me if I raise my hand?¨ Or maybe that student may need a different teaching approach, but they do not know how to convey this to them. There could be a solution to this problem. New technology uses a computer that ¨constructs a 3-D computer model of the face¨ (¨Making Mona Lisa Smile) it can be used to process the emotions that a student may be feeling. Meaning that technology reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and beneficial.

Reading the emotions of students can help the teachers gather more beneficial data on them. As they constantly say that ¨they are not mind readers.¨ However many students may be embarrased that they are not quite understanding the content. To which this technology could provide some assistance. The computer could simply read and see what percentage of the class is confused. If it is a large percentage then that means the teacher can go over it as a whole class. Also working vise versa meaning that if it is a smaller percentage then the teacher can make smaller groups and provide the needed attention to them. This theory was stated by Dr. Huang, ¨´A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,´ Dr. Huang predicts. ´Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor´¨ (¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨). Although the article refers to online classes the same can be applied to the human interative classroom. The teacher can look at the data during the lesson to check understanding along the way and then provide the extra needed support to those that need it. Then let those that understand it move forward. That way the children don´t fall behind, and the children that understand the content can be further challenged. Providing a more effective and rigourous courseload.

Another benefit that this technology presents is that it can read the distressing emotions of a student. Especially during the high school years which are very stressful in both the workload and character development. A teacher is able to see if that student is upset, angry, or stressed. Or even a combination of these emotions because ¨By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci´s masterpiece)¨ (¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨). If a student had a particularly stressful event go on in their household they may feel angry, frustrated, and sad. The teacher can then understand that they are going through a moment and be sure to provide some support. Also if the students are feeling especially stressed the teachers may even provide some kind of stress relief day, since prolonged stress can have some serious effects on the human body. This technology may even be able to detect mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety. To which the student can be provided with the support that they need. Possibly leading to the prevention of suicide attempts and anxiety attacks.

In conclusion, having technology in the classroom can be extremely beneficial to both the students and the teachers. It can provide useful data to the teachers. To which they can adjust their teaching plan accordingly, and effectively educate all the students. Futhermore it can help students dealing with mental health issues. Making sure that they get the help and support that they need in order to be the most attentive in the classroom as they can be. As technology continues to be implemented into the teaching program this computer software should be considered as well. ",5
0dba702,"Driverless cars are right around the corner according to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"". Everyday scientists and engineers are coming up with better techniques and programs for the cars of the future. These driverless cars, once they are fully driverless, can benifit mankind.

Driverless cars can benifit everyone. There are lots of car crashes everyday in big cities, but Google had made a car that can drive independently under certain conditions that can go half a million miles without a crash. If the technology gets better, people will not have to lay a finger on the steering wheel at all. There would not be as many drunk people causing car accidents if there was a fully driverless car because they will not have control of the vehicle.

I am ready to see a driverless car because if this car really does happen, then the roads will be a lot safer than what they are now. Safety is a big issue with a lot of states and some of them will not let any driverless cars be tested there. Manufacturers think that once they prove to the states that this car is safe on the road, then those states will support the use of driverless cars. Once the car is proved to be reliably safe, then some of the driving laws will have to be changed in order to keep up with the technology.

Technology will keep advancing, making these new cars even better than before. Driverless cars can be a good thing to the world, but there are aften some downsides to advancing technology. If some of these cars are made to run off of electricity and you forgot to plug it in to charge, then they could die and you will end up stuck somewhere. There are a lot of people that like the old ways of life without all of the technologies and will end up boycotting the car. Some technologies need to be more developed before being exposed to the public.

Even with the advancing technologies and the downsides that they have, I think driverless cars would be a good thing for everyone. They seem to be safer than people themselves while driving. There will be less car crashes than if people were to drive and that will result in less death. Technology is good, but this car is better than what is on the roads now and is becoming better as time goes on.",3

Many people believe that this car will be easy because you could sit back relax and text or watch Netflix but the cars may not be that Well and Improved so you never know what could happen so you would still have to watch out for other Vehicles, Animals ,Humans Etc.

In1976, Viking 1 saw the mesa and thought it looked like a face. But scientists found out that it was just a martian mesa.

On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera took a picture of the Mesa that looked like face. The picture was ten times better than the picture that the Viking 1 took. They found out that it was just a natural landform and that it wasnt an alien monument at all. Yet with all the proof some people did not believe that it wasnt just a regular Mars mesa due to that it was a cloudy year on Mars. So on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia and the Global Mars Surveyor got a second chance to look at the butte. The surveyor took a photo using its cameras absolute maximum resolution. The picture showed that it was just a Martian equivalent of a butte or a messa.

0dbd926,"Driverless cars could possibly be the next big thing around the world. Google has had cars that could drive independently since 2009. Their cars have driven over millions of miles with no crashes, but, google cars may not be one hundred percent driverless.

Having driverless cars is something I would actually like to see. I understand that when doing a lot of things that haven't really been done beore comes with many negative but also positive results. These cars will not always be driverless but robably about eighty or ninety percent of the time they will be. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam."" The car can function at speeds up to 25 mph. This is good because people won't have to worry about the cars driving at dangerous speeds. The cars can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when their help is needed. Some cars can alert the driver with vibrations through the seats which alerts the driver that the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time. In 2020 Mercedes Benz, Audi and other cars have planned to have cars that can drive themselves.

The cars we have now and days make drivers do all the work and sometimes the drivers manage to get lazy, but the driverless cars will make the driver become more attentive on the road. Manufactures are considering using cameras to make the driver have no choice but to focus on the road. These cameras will probably notice whether or not the driver is paying attention to the road and will have some type of voice or noise that makes the driver pay more attention.

I would like to see these cars driving around in the future. People will be surprised with how many positive results come out of this idea. But the question is who is left at fault if the technology fails and someone is injured, the driver or the manufacter?",3

0dcce8c,"When I think about owning a car that can drive itself it blows my mind. Never in a million years would I think that in my lifetime, this could be possible. Many people believe that driverless cars are a wonderful, innovative idea. On the other side some people believe that driverless cars could be dangerous. I favor driverless cars in most aspects, but it would be foolish to think one-sided.

There are many benefits of driverless cars. For me specifically, sometimes I find it hard to get rides to go places. With a driverless car I could go anywhere at anytime. In my family we are very busy, sometimes at different places at the same time. Sometimes I have rehearsal and my brother has wrestling practice while my parents are both at work. We do a lot of carpooling. With driverless cars it would be a lot easier.

There are some benefits but there are also some negatives of driverless cars. Even though the companies manufacturing these so called driverless cars have made sure they have every safety measure in place there are still somethings even they can't control. Weather can sometimes play a big role in how a car drives. Wind and rain can effect your driving and sometimes even eathrquakes and tornadoes strike when you are driving. Eventually they may produce a tool that could combat this but as of right now I don't know how we can get over this obstacle. Machines may react faster and smarter than humans but there will always a small fraction of accidents caused by animals or pedestrians in the road. I don't think we should take for granted this improvement though. Look at it like this, machines may not be perfect but they are certainly better than humans. Humans don't react as quickly. Think about drunk drivers, the amount of accidents caused by drunk would most likely be exponentially decreased.

With driverless cars I think our roads would be significantly safer. Although driverless cars are still a work in progress I think we have made a huge improvement to our safety. If this goes through to the next stage I wouldn't be suprised if we saw less death due to car accidents. That is my position on driverless cars.",3
0dcf2f6,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives the reader basic insight on what Venus is, its history, why scientists are trying to explore it, and the challenges scientists have faced.

Overall it is a very informative article and the point of it was to convince the reader that despite all of the struggles there is that comes with exploring Venus, that it is worth exploring anyway.

Though it is an admirable arguement, it is simply not supported throughout this type of article.

In the article, the author does not support his or her argument well because of his or her informative over-kill, lack of analysis, and lack of data in his or her favor.

To begin, the author gives us too many facts that are simply just an introduction. In paragraph three, the whole paragraph is stating facts about Venus and its atmosphere.

For example the author states that, ""...atmospheric pressure is 90 times great than what we experience on our own planet.""

This does resonate with the arguement considering that it is about how Venus should be explored despite the challenges.

The real problem with this example is that this is placed in the third paragraph and everything before it was also facts.

The author spent three paragraphs talking about the weather of Venus instead of analyzing how it should be disregared and we should explore it for better reasons. Additionally, the author gives facts that have nothing to do with the arguement provided.

In the second paragraph, the author states that, ""...sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.""

This simply has nothing to do with the supposed topic.

Not only is there too many facts, but these facts have nothing to do with the topic and the author seems to -in fact- trail off a bit.

Multiple times.

Additionally, the author seems to provide no analysis towards the plethera of information.

For example, the first true analysis is seen is in paragraph five when he or she states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

By the time someone is writing to paragraph five, there should already be an extreme of amount of noticable analysis before that.

The basic structure of any arguement would be to state a fact, and give a well thought-out analysis about that fact and how it applies to one's topic.

The noticable structure here, would be an overwhelming amount of facts, and then slight analysis by assuming that the evidence speaks for itself.

When you have that much information thrown at the reader at once, the evidence really doesn't speak for itself.

That's where the supposed analysis comes in.

The analysis is supposed to connect the dots for the reader and explain how it applies.

It seems that is lacking here.

Finally, the author seems to be arguing against themselves with the type of evidence that is being presented.

Throughout the whole article the author seems to be only stating the things wrong with this idea.

For example in paragraph two, the author states that, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for than a few hours.""

Then backed that up with no analysis on how that should be worth the risk so scientists can can continue exploring.

This is a problem because that is the point of the article: that despite all the risks, scientists should perservere. That's is not what followed that unsettling fact, though.

All that followed was more facts.

Additionally in paragraph six, the author finally states a good fact on how exploration can continue, but then follow it with analysis that once again goes against the arguement.

For example, after talking about the solution NASA has made to this problem, the author follow it with, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight...""

This was a poor choice of support because the author is basically going against his or her idea, without reconciling it.

In conclusion, the author makes it unclear which side he or she is trying to prove.

It is a very well-written article, but only for informational purposes.

If one it looking for a well-supported idea on how despite all the risks, science should continue, this article is not the place to look.

If anything, it seems that the author is arguing against continuing to explore Venus-considering all the facts and analysis that went against the idea.

Once again, this is a well written informative article, not an arguable one.",6
0dd2328,"Not needing anymore cars in the future ? that would be awsome and you could just teleport? that sounds so fun but scary at the same time. this really would change the world a lot.

Another thing would be cars with out people needing to drive on the drivers seat. such as like getting in a taxi, you just tell the car where you would like to go and where its locatced at just like you would to the man in the taxi. exept this time you dont have to pay your car for the distance it drove you just like you would pay a taxi man/woman.

This car would have to be like a ohone in order to drive its self but more technalgy put into it , because it has to have sencers so it will not hit another car that it is in front, side or behind you. and also it will need to have a very very advanced gps that will be have to be updated everytime there would be traffic, road blocks, road floding, construction on the road that is getting fixed, where all the new reaturants that have been just barley been built and open for service. This car need so much things installed to it for it will need to be perfect but not also is it just the car that will probably need to have things installed to it, also we would need to install chips on the stop lights. so there for the car can know when the light is on green to go, yellow to slow down for a stop, and red to atomaticlly stop. it would need to signal the car and give it a message letting it know what color the stop light know so there for it would give the car time to react to what it is instructed to do.

I was thinking, what if we had to install sincers on to or into the road so there for the car will not go off road and it will know what lane it has to stay on or take. then also guss what ? we would have to also maybe install sincers to the speed limit sign to where it will notificate the car how fast it should be going on the road or how fast it should be turnning on a certain road.

Know you see all the stuff we will need to do in order for people to have a car that will drive itself? this will cost a lot of money ! i mean a lot ! because you would have to bulid all of that and install all of that to the whole untied states ! thats a lot of money just for a car that drives itself. its cool but i mean this will only make people lazy to not drive at all. In my opinion, this is a very bad idea when we really dont need it. ",3

In August 1945, I boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and I has heading for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. When I arrived in Greece I was 18, which meant I could be drafted for military service. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. By the time I was discharfed in 1947, I had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys and I would play baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. We would have Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also to help pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up a new world for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

So other people who want to be in the Seagoing Cowboys Program, you will have a adventure of an life time.     ",2
0dd6015,"Dear Senator,

I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will acheive when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us.  Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral collge consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winner-take-all system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will acheive great things for our country.

Thank you for keeping my thoughts in mind,

0dd72fb,"Is studying Venus worthy to pursuit the ande it will presents in the future? In the article of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states about why humans should study Venus. Students and humans should study Venus because they can anticipate will happen to the Earth, why no spaceshifts have been to Venus for more than three decades, and more importantly, how techonology can help us.

First,Venus is the second planet from the sun and it is not difficult to see from distance but it does takes up safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challengeing place ro examine more closely. Astronomoes are fascinated by Venus on how it may once have been the most Earth like plantet in our Solar Systems.

Next, for the past three decades of years, previous missons was unmaned and not a single spacecrafts survided the landing to Venus for more than a few hours. This explanins why not a single spaceshifts have touched down to Venus for quite a long time. The National Areonautics and Space Administrations want to send humans to study Venus so that the possible hostile conditon on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to flot above the fray.

Finally, Modern computers are enormouslt powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons. For example exposing a cell phone or a tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. Therefore systems that use mechanicals parts can be made of more resistants to pressure, heat, and other forces. Devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require eletronics.

In conclusion, if we humans study Venus, we would likely be preapred for what will happen next in the future but humans returning to Venus seem indisputable. Our travels on Earth should not be linited by dangers and dobuts but it should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. We should be able to help our Earth for dangers coming in.   ",4
0de71cb,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author effectively supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by arguing that it is the closest and most similar planet to Earth and highlighting the strides made by NASA that would keep humans safe on Venus. These two points are made in order to convince readers that the good outweighs the bad through logic and scientific discoveries.

The author begins with the argument that Venus is the most similar to Earth. This is a good argument to make because it lowers the ambiguity which may cause those opposed some heartburn. The text reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This provides insight into the physical makeup of Venus that needs to be explored while showing that it has similar features to Earth. They also mention that it is the closest planet to Earth which lowers the amount of space travel. This could be a safer option as it would lessen the amount of complications on the way there that are caused by long periods of time. Next, the author uses NASA to prove that exploration of Venus would be safer due to scientific discoveries and manuevers. According to the text, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" From there the author acknowledges the shortcoming of that idea due to distance and lists out innovative technologies that could get closer to the surface, the first being a mechanical computer. The mechanical computer does not rely on technology and is made of material that could combat the intense heat of Venus. This is an effective way of proving the claim because it provides one solution, acknowledges its faults, and provides another solution to remedy that. This does not leave room for an opposing arguement because the opposition work has already been done. Lastly, the author makes an effort to appeal to the emotion of the reader. The author states, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". They claim that if we never explore Venus due to doubt, then we can never explore other places that may give us some doubt as well. Essentially, they claim that fear should not stop exploration.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author makes the case for the exploartion of Venus despite the dangers by using a number of arguments that appeal to readers both logically and emotionally. The author effectively supports the idea by using evidence from trusted sources, like NASA, and putting them together to make a logical arguement that could appeal to readers.      ",4
0de82fe,"Is a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" a real thing? People might think that it is just a silly pretend game, but it is actually a group of people that were hired by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). The UNRRA was created to help the countries that were left in ruins by the end of World War II, and the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" were hired to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Since I was 16 I started crossing the Atlantic Ocean, helping the people of the world start a new life, and it felt amazing. So, would anyone join me along my adventure across the oceans, seas, and rivers of the mysterious earth?

The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" is a great program that is helping the people of the world, and also serving your own country. Like in the paragraph 4, of the article, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" 'Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. ""When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-bout trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""'

Being a Seagoing Cowboy, is an opportunity of a lifetime, like in paragraph 5, of the article, ""A Cowboy who Rode the Waves."" I say, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" Also, in paragraph 5, I say, '""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""'

As well as the work of hauling bales of hay and bags of oats up from the lower holds, and cleaning stalls, we had lots of fun on the trips we took together. In paragraph 8, in ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" it states, 'The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table- tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gamed also helped padd the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was special to me, helping people in need, serving my country, living an opportunity of a lifetime, and having fun while doing it. It only takes courage and bravery to sail the ocean as a Seagoing Cowboy. So, is anyone joining with me on my journey to Europe as a Seagoing Cowboy?",3
0deace1,"The Face on Mars

Have you heard about the Face on mars? Well if you haven't the Face is a picture Nasa took on Mars, this figure looks like a humans face. People agure that's possibly aliens did this, others agure that it's just part of the

natural landmark on Mars. I believe that it's just part of the landform and that aliens have nothing to do with the Face.

I believe that the Face is just part of natural landform, because there is no proof that aliens are even real. in the article it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing..... a natural lanmark. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that the Face has nothing to do with aliens. Some people believe that the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on mars- evidence that Nasa would rather hide. I would say that there no reason why Nasa would lie and cover up the truth if something is living in Mars. If there were somthing that cause the Face, Nasa would of revealed it, because they would get more money. Once nasa went to take the picture again in April '98 it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Skeptics still didn't believe Nasa that the Face was just natural landform. They argured that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Although Nasa knows there is no proof that aliens excist so we can't predict that aliens have something to do with the Face. After all people have different opinion on this.

There will still be people who believe it just a natural landform and others that think it has to do something with aliens. I still agree with Nasa that the Face is just part of the land on Mars. If some type of creature lived there then we would of discovered it by know. Back then we might not have had all the technology, but by now we would of discovered if someing was living on Mars. For now people will keep discussing their opinions on the Face. ",2

OUR

money . I say lets go with popular vote not some elector in a monkey suit. We let them have a ""winner-take-all"" system as stated in paragraph 7 from an excerpt from "" What Is The Electoral College "". Why do we need make the District of Columbia like their own state , why should we go threw all the hassel of putting certain numbers of electors for each state when we can just go with popular vote. The vote we have.

Why do we need such an abomination for voting, when we can all vote for the person we want to win the election not, just some group of electors Democratic or Republican so they can vote for us .

We as the

PEOPLE

should have the right to vote for our selves. It's such a crazy process ,we could just as easly mess up who we voted for , it's not always very clear .

WE

dont even really vote for our Electors. ""Well who does ? "" you ask. The state conventions ,sometimes the state party , sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. We should be lucky that the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century ; but this process could end up getting much worse like in 1960. The segregtions almost led to no more Democratic electors. We still proceed with all evidence as to why we shouldnt have Electoral Colleges.

We do have democratic electors but the Electoral College is a very non-democratic process. People in favor of this say even since 2000 when Gore had more popular votes than Bush but fewer electoral votes it hadn't since 1888 . We are the the people we should have a voice that rings loud and clear , not one who whispers under the big booming voice of the people the higher leaders think have a bigger say. We should be the majority not the minority. Even in favor of the Electoral college you can see the many flaws that have come about the age old process. You have the swing states that follow a ""winner-take-all"" method.

Then we have the big states that use some of their large states. like in Florida the 2012 election the state had a very close popular vote and got 29 electoral voates. Then it came down to Wyoming with 3 electoral votes and it took all.

Now I hope you can see why We should toss the Electoral College out the second story window. The vote's come to close to call in a lot of these runnings. The people we vote for can always turn their backs. Plus it just gets to caiotic to handle even when we treat the district of Columbia a state.

Lots of people would take advantage of a driveless car, and wouldn't be aware of the dangers that follow. Before anyone gets into a driveless car we need smart drivers.

There are still many car crashes today. Berfore we begin to make cars that can drive by itself we need to figure out how to stop car crashes now. In the article it says that if the car is in danger, or coming across a contrustion zone whatever the case may be, it would alert the driver to take the wheel. But shouldn't it be the other way around some drives might panic or won't know what to do. Since it is a ""smart"" car it should be able to handle situations like that.

0dff325,"Dear state senator,

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. I say this because, as successful as the Electoral College has been, it has many flaws. In the first sentence of the eleventh paragraph, the article mentions something called the disaster factor. This is an alarming possiblity. State legislatures are, in a way, responsible for choosing electors who may ignore the will of the people.

During 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, people titled Segregationists almost succeeded in removing the Democratic electors and replacing them with new electors. These new electors were supposed to oppose John F. Kennedy so that any popular votes for Kennedy would not have really gone to him. If those Segregationists had succeeded in their plan, John F. Kennedy would not have won the popular vote. That was indeed a close call, and it could happen yet again in the near future without fail. On another similar topic, ""faithless"" electors have, from time to time, denied the option to vote for their party's candidate. Instead of voting for the candidate of their own party, they cast a vote for whomever they wish.

Also occuring in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. Thankfully, he was presiding over the Senate at the time. He made sure to validate the slate of his choosing ""without establishing a precedent."", as stated in paragraph eleven, sentence 9. Hopefully, this will not occur again anytime soon.

The most worrying occurance would be a tie. However, if a tie were to happen in an electoral vote, the election would be thrown towards the House of Representatives. There, the state delegations vote on the president. In 1976, a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters from Hawaii had voted the other way. This is bad because the election is only a few voters away from a distaster. In conclusion, the Electoral College is not only unfair, but outdated and irrational. It should be shifted from the way it is now to total amount of popular votes for the president of the United States.    ",4
0e00dde,"The self driving car, it used to be a dream of the futre but is now a reality.

As new technology appears, new distractions rise as well.

The well beilng of people is important, especially while driving.

Therefore Cars that can drive themselves are safer and more reliable.

With the increase of self driving cars, it means the more they are tested and the safer they get.

Self driving cars are safer because they have sensors all around, that means that the car is fully aware of its surroundings and is constantly analizing what is going on around it, something most people don't do.

The sensors used are not new, ""In the 1980s, automaker used speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock brakes"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming,5).

Since sensors are not new that means that there has been plenty of time to improve them and increase their safety. Like people the sensors in self driving cars can, ""...cause the car to apply bakres on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming,5).

But sensors can do that much quicker than people, which makes the car and driving much safer.

Self driving cars are much more relaible than most people.

They are more reliable because the driverless cars are less likely to cause an accident.

With new technology rising today, like smart phones, tablets, and computers, the amount of distracted drivers increase as well.

But with the self driving cars people won't be as distracted and driving because the car itself would do most of the driving.

Also if there was a need for the driver to take over, there is plenty of ways to get the drivers attention like; ""...flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 7).

The driverless cars are also reliable because the option of using cameras to make sure the driver is not distracted and focused on the rode is increasing, which is more reliable than just trusting that the person is paying attention to the road.

The self-driving cars can insure peoples safety with sensors.

They are also more reliable by decreasing accidents by making sure the driver is paying attention.

Therefore by being safe with sensors, and reliable for peoples well being, driverless cars are a positive mode of transportation.   ",3

If the driver is bored, then they may take their eyes off of the road or even drift off to sleep. When the time comes to take the wheel, they may not be prepared and accidents will happen.

The autonomous cars drempt by many corporations are not just dangerous for the owners of these machines, but other drivers as well. If an owner of a driverless car becomes distracted, other drivers will have to take action to avoid the misshaps of the automonous vehicle. More accidents could very well happen as a consecence of avoiding an accident. Attempting to avoid an accident may also cause not just one, but many as a result of a pile up.

The problems with these cars are very clear. While they may be fun toys for the rich, they should not be put on public streets. The dangers outweigh the convenience. These machines are just not safe enough for the public and should not be sold.",4
0e0ef1b,"In ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents . Some key datails to support the authors claim are that the planets conditions are not survivable for humans to live on despite how earth like it is compared to any other planets in our solar system . "" On the planet's surfave, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" this shows how dangerous it would be to live on this planet and how hard it would be to try to land and get information of anything scientist could study .

""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel "" this shows how earth - like venus is despite how dangerous it is , and the authors claim of studying Venus despite the dangers it presents suggest that the author believes it would be good to gather information about the planet for scientist to study despite the bad conditions so maybe we can make and figure out better technologies to maybe habit this planet in the future .

The challenge of exploring venus is the bad conditions of weather and how it is nothing like our planet and right now at the time , it is not possible to survive in those conditions . Venus is the closing thing to our earth in apperance atleast in our solar system , and if scientist get infomation from landing despite the conditions , we might one day figure out a way to habit the planet in the future .

0e222f1,"Driveless Cars are a great impact in the world and it can change the lives of others , also. Driveless cars are cars that can drive by it self without having help with a driver. Well, in certain occations. It depends on the condtions that are happening in the streets. For instance, backing up out of your drive way or trying to avoid a object in the street but that is all simple things drivers can do with their cars. In the article, ""Driverless cars Are Coming"", the author states alot of negative and positive things about driverless cars. However, Driverless cars are a positive aspect. In addition, these cars can help and impact many peoples lives. Going for driverless cars can change the way people drive and will make it easier for the drivers to drive.

Driverless cars can change the way how we see cars now, change the way of drving, and how it makes it easier for the drivers to drive in the streets. For instance, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheel and reduce power fro the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could ever manage alone"",(p.5). Driveless cars have more potential in driving than humans do. They are more aware in whats going on in the streets than humans do drving on the streets. To add, they have better responses dealing with danger, such as, people crossing the street unexpectedly or cars turning out of nowhere whe there suppose to do so. Another example is, "" The can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, suuch as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over whe the situation requires"",(p.7). Driverless cars have all the basic fundamentals in order to drive on the streets. In fact, they notify humans when they need help in certain situations. This car idea will help drivers pay more aware whats going on even though the car can drive by itself. This is like helping a baby to walk. The parent lets go as the baby starts to walk. Trying to catch its balance and the baby falls. The parent is aware that the baby falls and the parent picks the bay back up to continue on walking. Nothing is wrong will a little help even if the Driverless car is struggling to go around something or backing up for it to drive independently. The driver is aware and alerted and will guide the car to its direction and the driverless car will continue driving to where you want to go. There is always going to be problems with driverless cars. However it can make your life much easier, espcially, driving wise. The examples explain that driverless cars can have its ups and down but it will make people's lives much easier. These cars will help people become safer and alerted to whats going on around them and in result, there would be less car accidents

In summary, driverless cars can change the world deeply and will make it a saver place on the streets. It will make it easier for the drivers. Futhermore, driverless cars are more smarter, driving wise, when on the road than the drivers. That would create less stupidity of driving and more of boat smarts.        ",3
0e22bc3,"We have been fascinated on driverless cars since the late 1950s.There is both pros and cons when it comes to the aspects of driverless cars. Sergey the google cofunder envisions a futeer with a public transportation sysytem theat would use half the fuel of a taxi .The car would even have more flexability than a bus .driverless cars could fundamerntally change the world. But there are roadblocks that lies ahead for driverless cars

The companies that are making driverless cars for example, General Motors created a special test track that has electrical cables in them that send radio signals to the front end to the car. The road systems worked really well surprisingly but was to exspensive to build .So google modified the toyota prius with sensors on the wheel ,the roof , and a gps receiver.and a internal motion sensor the car had ther skill of a human driver behind the wheel.

Even though, the car could basically drives itself it could not handle such things like work zones and around accidents.the car simply notifys the driver to take over but how would the driver remain focoused on the raod? Why would annyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? . The aspects of

automation is really challenging because wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for there turn to drive?

Safety is aslo a very big concern such as keeping drivers,passengers and pedestrians safe. We know safety is best when the driver is alert and in control at all times so how would that happen if they arent driving most of the time?There are not even any liability laws yet so if the technology fails who would be acccountable the driver or the manufactuar? In some states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars . so is it as safe as we thought it woul be?

The devlopment of the driverless stretches ahead of us. we grow closer to finding the answers that we need to figure out if the autonomous is truly right for us .Even though,its some good points that need to be figured out about the driverless car.But it wouldnt be truly right until we get them all figured out.until then we get closer to that destination every day.",4
0e233ca,"In the years of 1976, a spacecraft snapped photographs for possible sites for the Viking 2 to land. In the photo that was taken, a fairly large head-looking object that was nearly 2 miles long was on the Red Planet. This caused many people to believe; What if there's life on Mars? It seems like a head but i strongly believe it is just a natural landform.

Scientists have proved that the theories of the object being a sign of life was highly unlikely. However when it comes to consipiracy theories, people are very stubborn to believe them without any proof. The scientists figured that it was simply a mesa which is pretty common around there except according to the text, ""-this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Later, the image was unveiled and it certainly caught a lot of attention!

Since it caught a lot of people's attention, it soon starred in a Hollywood film, was in books, magzines, and radio talk shows according to the text. This would obviously cause more people to believe it is a sign of life on Mars, since it went so viral. But the thing is is that it is not evidence of life, yet so many say it is. It has not been scientifically proven. NASA themsleves have said that it is just a natural landform. Also, movies, magazines, and books overexaggerate things so they really aren't evidence.

I believe it is a landform just like any other. Here on Earth, we have plenty of landforms. According to the text, scientists have said that landforms are very common around there, specifically Martian mesas. Coincidentally, this landform just so happened to be shaped like a head. There are plenty of landforms and other objects that look like other objects. Here on earth we could have a rock shaped like a heart or a pond shaped like a nose.

I also believe that it is just the people's imagination that leads them to believe this. Sometimes our imaginations and theories can't always be correct. There are plenty of conspiracy theories out there. I believe that if you do not have solid evidence for such theories, don't believe them.

On April 5, 1998, the object was proven to be a natural landform which proved some scientists wrong about their theories about it being an alien monument. It was proven by the Mars Global Surveyor which flew over Cydonia to check on the unusual object. This proves that there is no life on Mars and that the ""face"" is just a natural landform.

According to the text, it really is the Martian equivalent of a mesa or a butte which are common around the American West. So this concludes my argumentative essay on why I believe the Face is just a natural landform.                   ",4
0e277d7,"Have you ever wondered if anyone can tell how you are feeling? Well now someone or a computer actually can!

According to text the author states that this new source of technology (FACS) can be very helpful for students in school while using the computers. I highly agree. I agree that this technology can be very helpful towards us students because not all us have fun doing work , espically on the computers. The passage states that a computer can tell wether your happy , sad , or even bored . I think thats very helpful because it can help us students to not be bored or to not be upset while doing the work on the computers.

Many times when students go into the computer labs most of them end up on game sites playing games while doing the work or most of them end up falling asleep . The main reason students do that is because there either bored doing the work or either tired and dont want to do the work because they are confused. The technology as Dr. Huang states that "" it could then modify the lesson, like a human instructor. I would love that a computer can help you and read the lesson for you because I had plenty of teachers who were either boring or always had me confused on the lesson.

Last but certainly not least the technology can feel your emotion so that way they understand you. Most teachers would not understand why you are having trouble or why you do not want to do the work. I think thats very helpful on us because the computer can then help you improve on getting the work done .

I strongly agree on this new source of technology because its finally helping us students and even the teachers in school .

In all i say this technology known as FACS will be very valuable in many schools , espically if teachers are having trouble with students who can not do the work or are feeling some type of way.

Whenever this source is available

im sure it will be very succesful around the world and i suggest my school to use this .",3

What you do as a Seagoing Cowboy is deliver supplies and food for the cattle of the people's homes that were distroyed in World War 2. I know that you think this might sound boring but it is actually really intresting because you get to go to alot of different places and see alot of sights. For example, '' I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Pananama Canal on my way to China.'' Now I bet you see how fun it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy, so come and join!",2
0e2b2aa,"When my friend Don Reist offered me on a trip to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I had to say yes, I knew I would never be able to do ever again. It was really fun doing it and special at the same time because I got to help people in need and see Europe and China. I also played a lot off games and we got to just sit there and look at the Pacific Ocean.

First off the best part was that I got to help people in need. I mean these people had nothing everything they had got like wipped out. I got to go all over the place just helping people. All the places we got to see were all so pretty and delightful. By the time i go discharged i had alredy made nine trips that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Next getting to see all over Europe and China was also really fun. I got to take a gondola ride in Vencice,Italy, that is the city with streets of water. A fun part was after the animals got unloaded. We played games like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whitting in the empty holds were the animals used to be.

Finally all in all the trip made me understand there are people in other countries that need help. If you were everable to do this and you did I bet you really enjoyed yourself. Hopefully by all of these details you will want to sign up for a trip to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It is not all fun and games, your really have to do stuff like feed the animals. If it wasn't for my friend Don Reist I would have never got to witness this amazingness.",2
0e2b7d1,"""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Owning a vehicle helps get people from one place to another faster then just walking but some people really don't understand that there are advantages to not owning a vehicle. In the excerpts ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"", ""The end of car culture"" both by Elizbath Rosenthal and ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, all explain how limiting car usage can help lower emission and conserve resources.

In the excerpt ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal explains why limiting car usuage would help lower emissions. For example, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are polluting the eniviroment that we all live in and are destroying the atomosphere because of all these greenhouse gases swirling through the air because of the use of cars. Furthermore, referring to another excerpt ""The end of car culture"" from Elizabeth Rosenthal also, proves why limiting car usuage will lower emission rates. For instance, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down to two to three years before the turndown...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" As you can see owning a car can be a advantage to your personal life but the enviroment is suffering because of the fumes from the vehicles everyone own but if less people start to walk more, ride bikes or even hike the enviroment wouldn't be suffering from so many emissions.

Likewise, in the excerpt ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer highlights how limiting car usage can help conserve resources. For example, ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world...Cold night and warm days caused the layer of air to trap car emissions."" Going back to what Rosental was pointing out emissions are still triggering the atmosphere. But, that is not the only thing that is being blamed for pollution. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has...[a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe, accoring to Reuters."" Without any gasoline nobody will be traveling from one place to another so to conserve resources people are better off limiting the usage of their cars.

In conclusion, using cars less would help to lower emissions and conserve resources such as in this case gasoline. If everyone keeps driving aroud in cars the air is going to be full of Greenhouse gases and eventually resources to run cars will soon run out. Then without a car to take people where they need to go people will have no choice but to walk, ride a bike, or take public transportaton because everything id worn and ran out. This is why limiting car usage is a advantage for fellow citizens because it helps lower emissions and conserves resources.    ",3
0e3c6eb,"I am one of the many scientist of NASA and what i'd like for people to understand is that the ""face on mars"" is really just a natural landform of the moon and not any ancient civilization on Mars. Although our defenders of our budget and some of us certainly wish there was a form of life on Mars.

What it is that your seeing that you call a face on mars is a Mesa. The mesa or the huge rock formation,you all have seen has ended up unlike some other mesas,ended up resembeling a human head. Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. This very well did draw all of your attention to Mars which is somewhat good for your knownledge,but with you all thinking there is aliens of some sort it is hard to come by whats true or not to some that have not picked a side of whos right or wrong.

We had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view and it was a clear photo we took from that so if they're were any objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were! So again but lastly What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. It also reminded Jim Garvin of most of middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa that is somewhat the same height as the Face in Mars.",3
0e426b4,"Have you ever had a dream about a car driving itself while you just layed back and relaxed? So have many other people. Companies have been working on developing a self driving car. There have been hopes and stories about this since as early as the 1950's, but now we have the technology to actually do this wonderful thing.

At the beginning of this experimentation for the self driving car, lots of people trying to get it to work were using ""smart"" roads. Roads that had electrical cables or magnets in it, but the cost for ""smart"" roads would not be worth it. ""Smart"" cars though are cheaper than fixing and replacing all of the roads in the world. ""Smart"" cars had many sensors, video cameras, and a GPS receiver. They have a sensor on top of the car that is constantly making a three-dimentional model of the cars surrounding so the car can react to what is going on around it.

The Google ""smart"" cars have been in progress since the year 2009. Their cars have driven a bit over half a million miles, and the cars have yet to get into an accident. So by logical conclusion, the ""smart"" cars reduce the accidents that happen or at least reduce the frequency. Then cars are still not fully done. Yet some places are allowing companies to test the cars out on open roads, such as: California, Florida, District of Columbia, and Nevada. Sadly these cars are not fully complete so some still need the assistance of humans when it comes to accidents or moving to avoid the work zones.

""Smart"" cars are very useful and have alot of wonderful benifits to them. These cars will very much likely use less fuel than the average car or taxi. They are less pron to get into accidents than human driven cars. They will take a bit more supplies to make these cars be able to do everything the need to be able to do to handle the real roads, but with all the money saved on fuel and all the money saved on not having as many accidents, it will all be worth it.

These ""smart"" cars are revolutionary and are changing the world, and as science continues to change and evolve each day, I'm sure we will soon aceive the goal of a car that con completely drive on its own with no human help. They take less gas and reduce the number of accidents. Who can complain with that. What do you say? Are you for or against self driving cars?",2
0e46514,"Transportation has been a part of society for as long as the worlds been turning. It all depends what mode of transport you are willing to take on a daily basis. Cars are becoming fewer and fewer in some places of the past few years. People are less dependant on personal transportation which in turn creates a safer, healthier enviroment for ourselves and the others around us.

By limiting car usage the main reaction would be less pollution and less smog in largeer cities. Places like New York, Paris, Berlin, London, or Beijing could look so much better. Everywhere you look you see and hear about pollution and Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming. All this is caused mainly by humans hand and the cars we drive spitting out toxic Carbon Dioxide wastes. In Paris they had a one day ban of half the cars in the city and the smog went away in that amount fo time.(Source 2) If we limited cars we could unlimit our world to a new, longer lifespan, because cars are truly ripping our planet to pieces.

The chance of finding public transportation in America is very slim. Most places you go don't have subways or things like ""der U-Bahn"" in Deutschland. Our counrty is made for cars and we throw money at them every year which will eventually come to bite America in the butt. 80 percent of appropriations have gone to higways and the rest goes to other types of transport in America.(Source 1) By creating more viable public tansportation methods we could cut the spending on highways and put the money back into public transportation. By doing so we could limit accidents at the wheel and reduce pollution which I mentioned earlier. We already know that this system works in Vauban, Deutschland where residents rarely own cars and they live happier, quainter lives. (Source 1)

The time to by a car is not now. Recent studies show that car purchases, licenses, and driving has become fewer as each year goes on.(Source 4) Either from high vehicle and gas prices or an actual social spectical, driving is slowly decreasing all over the world. Hopefully within the next 25 years, public transportation will be a MUST in cities all over the globe, and I'm not just talking about buses. People are more reliant on planes and trains in Europe than any other continent. And we could benefit highly from what we learn elsewhere.

If we just join together and stop driving alltogether for just one day, the results would be both extraordianry and frightening. We have neglected to see that by not limiting our car usage we have limited our time on this planet. Hopefully our generation will correct the wronging of past generations and improve transportation so it isn't such a loud and obnoxtious hinderence.                     ",4

0e4855c,"Luke's point of view is that other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason is because you get to go to different places. Another reason is because Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with Katie.

You get to go to different places like Greece, and by time he got to Greece he was 18 years old that meant that he could draft for military service. Then he could see Europe and China. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept luke busy. They had to feed and water them two to three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with aunt Katie's farm as a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not the dangers at the sea. He had different jobs each time. The second time he was a watchman. And his job was to check the animals every hour.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It had opened the world to him. But he was greatful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of of people of other countries and their needs. And the awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That is why Luke's point of view for people to participate in the Seagoing Cow boys. And I think that it would be good for people to do what he did that way you get to go to different places that you may of not been to before. And that way you get to see what it's like on the sea taking care of all the animals and all of the jobs that you have to do.

It would be cool if people would do what Luke did that way you get a learning time where you get to see what it was like for Luke and do what he did I think that it would be cool I we did that. And If we did what he did I think that it would be fun takeing care of the animals and on a sea ride and going to different places that are in different countries to see what there life is like and how they eat and things like that would be cool.",2

Also the Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france , compared to a 5.3 percant average of the diesel engimes in the rest of western Europe , according to reuters. Still however indicates The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and the Violators faced $25 fines. The Article also states As April  2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below th peak and equal to where the country was in januart 1995.

One Reason, Fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage are going out of controll because in the article Ingerman Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars states Automoblies are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle- class familes From chicago to shanghai tens to make their homes and that , experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpies for the passenger car are responsibe for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in sime car intensive areas in the united states. But in paris bans driving dur to smog takes about while exceptions were made for plug in cars,hybrids, and carrying three or more passengers.

Another Reason,fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage are going out of control because it incates President obamas ambitions goals to curb the united staes greenhouse gas emissons, unveiled lastweek, will get a fortuitios assist from an incipient shoft in american behavior also recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each years goes by. the days without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in bogotoa in the mid 1990s.

0e51031,"The author suggest that studying Venus is worth it despite the risk,probably because he thinks that Venus and Earth are similar.Or because he thinks we may find life on Venus then Mars also because Venus is closer to Earth then Mars is.

According to the passage the author states that ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth.""The texts also states that""Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those of Earth.The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters.The text also states that ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.For example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's Surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""

There are also many differences in our planet compared to Venus. For example""On the planet Venus the surface tempeatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.The texts also states that ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet ir our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to the sun,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""The text also states that""the conditions are far more extreme that anything else humans have encountered on Earth,Such an enviornment would crush even a submarine accustomed to driving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

In conclusion I personally dont think that its a good idea risking lifes to explore Venus even if it may be Earth's ""Twin"" it's too dangerous and to risk to send people to explore life forms up there,It will also be way to risk if they dont find any kind of life on Venus while they're risking there lifes.

0e54b40,"Venus is one of the planetary system, and the second closest planet to the sun, which makes it dangerous for stargazers to explore. The author believed we should explore Venus no matter how dangerous it is because, Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideraton given the long time frames of space travel.

Venus is one of the hottest and dangerous planet, but the author believed that we should still explore the planet becuase it is Earth's twin in terms of size and density, and also in distance too. The author explained that Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth making NASA intriguing to study more about Venus. The author also came up with ideas on how to visit Venus to avoid the dangers of the planet, according to the text, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" The author gave a possible solutions to NASA that might make them avoid exploring Venus, by getting a vehicle that act just like the jets airplanes on Earth to stay up and out of the way of Venus unfriendly ground conditions.

In the story, the author supports the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author believed we should think of it as a challenge, because Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. ",3
0e54efc,"Many people have different oppinions over driverless cars. Some may think that driverless cars are dangerous or just outright wrong. While some people may think that driverless car is a big step for this world, and could be very helpful. Now both groups are neither right or wrong but there are pros and cons to driverless cars. One pro is that nowadays out technology is very advanced so in driverless cars they're putting the best sensors and technology in the cars to make them as safe as possible. One

con is that these cars can handle normal driving functions but when it comes to workzones, traffic jams, or backing out of driveways they need a human to assist. I believe that driverless cars could very well help this country. Even though there are cons i think the pros out number them. So in conclusion, driverless cars may scare some but in the future these cars will be perfected and the accident rate will decrese. ",2
0e5feb0,"The autthor of the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus has used some substanital evidence to try and coax us twoards believing that Venus a a planet that has not been studied as much as it should be but i think other wise. Venus is a risky investment with the technology that we have a availble. I belive we waste time and money on Venus where it could be used on existing problems and studies on a planet where it will be moost effective.

One portion of the passage that the author tried to push in your face was the fact that Venus had/has a great deal of geographical similarities to Earth. He said thisngs such as "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size""

which appeal to a certain group of individuals who are afcinated by the thought of there being somewhere else like earth. The author also says "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This also would appeal to that same group of pepole giving them the thought that they are going to be able to live on Venus but still there are the harsh living conditions that contrdict that thinking.

In opposition to what the author says about Venus and its geographical similarites we also need to talk about the differences that cause problems not only for living on the planet but also studying it. Venus has an atmosphere that is ""97 percent carbondioxide""

which alone has ended the thought that Venus can any longer sustain life as they think i could before. Also the atmosphere makes it hard to even get any documentation on how the planet looks. In paragraph 7 the author uses the substance silicon carbide as an example of a way to get around the crazy atmoshpere but this leads me to my next point that the author failed to even mention in the passage, all of this study and exploration costs money.

The author forgot to mention one of the most cruccial pecies to the equation which is where is funding coming from and where could the money be used more effectivly. Or economy at the moment is not stable and be are in great need of help but that does'nt mater to some. They are more focused on the future how we are going to advance but without a good present situation there is no way we could proceed. The money could be given to the city of Flint, Michigan so that they are able to drink and bathe themselves with clean water. Im sure that it costs way less to fix the pipelines in city that to take years and fly to Venus.

Venus and the other planets are cool specticals but we were given our own plant that we have beaten and mistreated for years but we don't to go back and fix the problem search for somewhere else to destroy. I think that we should at least try to better the situaton with the money that we have for the planet that we have not to spend on the expoloration of the others.",4
0e680b3,"I am personally against the idea of driverless cars. Some people are already dangerous behind the wheel as it is. I don't think a computer would do any better behind the wheel. Dirverless cars can be very dangerous and I think people would be better off not being lazy and driving themselves where ever they needed to go.

One reason that I am against driverless cars is that they are not 100% driverless. There are still issues that the car can't handle on it's own and will require the driver to take over. Driverless cars can be very dangerous because if the car would ever require the driver, and it fails to alert the driver in time, there could be fatal consequences. Drunk drivers could also try to take advantage of the fact that the car would be driverless and have the car drive itself. But if he driver were to be too drunk to take over, it could casue a very bad accident.

Another reason that I am against driverless cars is that they would be compter dependent and would run on it's own. And every skilled programmer or hacker would know that you would be able to hack the computer driven car to do what ever they wanted it to. Hackers can already hack a lot of vehicles as it is, they can send codes to a smart vehicle to unlock and even start the car without owning or having the key to the car. There are way too many dangerous things that could possibly happen with that to list. Hackers could change the course of the vehicle to any given location, they could make the car crash itslef, and they could make the car failt to alert the driver and every one would blame either the driver or the car.

One final reason that I am against driverless cars is that people today are already lazy enough as it is. We don't need computers taking over our lives. People are becoming more and more dependent on technology causing them to be lazier. One example that has already been made is in the Movie Wall-E where everyone was in floating chairs that were controlled so no one would ever have to walk again, making them even lazier and very obese.

I am really against driverless cars and I think that they would do way more harm than good no matter how much time, effort, and improvements they have made on it. I think we are better off just driving ourselves where ever we needed to go and that we should be less dependent on technology istead of being completley dependent on it.   ",4
0e6da97,"Wanna keep the ozone nice and clean? or how about not being stuck in traffic? Sounds good not having to be stuck in traffic huh? Well theres a way that, that can happen. All you have to do is not drive your car as much. Not driving your car means you can stay out of the way of traffic and not have to spend so much money on gas so much. Limiting the amount of car usage is good because it can save tons of money and could save you so much more if you just ride your bike.

According to the article ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine ($31)."" This means that places are getting more strict about driving and they should cut back because it is harmful to the enviornment. Also limiting the amount of car usage could be good too so there wont be as much traffic on the road anymore. Its good because that means that people will not need to use so much gas and the price of gas should go down becasue the amount of people not using it would make it cheaper and more affordable.

Another good reason is itll stop the ozone layer and itll make it smaller than it is now by using cars so much all that bad stuff is going into it and the hole is getting bigger and bigger. Also it helps because your saving the earth and limiting the amount of polutions a car throws out.

It is very important to have them not use cars as much because itll do amazing things one day if everybody does it and it could stop so much polution and make gas priceses super low adn affordable. So cutting back on using your car is important and it would save you tons of money and you could buy a bike if you needed to. Also you could use diesle because it is a lot safer than gas and it can be more expensive but its way worth it.               ",2

You would be helping people because sometimes there are natural disasters like hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, and many more. Also, you would be able to help people after wars ended. You can help people that have these problems by bringing them food, water, building materials, and other items that they need for daily living. Helping someone always feels fantastic beause you know that you did the right thing.

Being over sea for so long with other people would mean that you would most likely end up being friends. With everybody being friends you would be able to have so much fun. Being over sea with a bunch of friends means that you would be really entertained. This would be enteraining because you could keep yourselves entertained by playing table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. All of these would pass time. Also, if you have never been on a boat before then you would be able to experience something new! You could argue that being oversea would be to dangerous but here's why your wrong, you would be on a boat that always has someone watching for danger so you would be safe.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would also be very adventurious. You would get to see new places while doing something good for the world.

0e73ffd,"In this article it talked about the position on driverless cars informing people about the driverless cars and what it can do. Google's driverless car can be a good thing worldwide. The driverless car is safe and it has been driven for more than half a million miles without a crash, although Google is not truly driverless it alerts the driver to take over when it needs pulling out of the driveway, the car is able to handle driving at a speed up to 25 miles per hour, and the car comes with a special touch sensor that can make sure the driver is able to keep hold of the wheel.

The car is safe and Google has cars that was dable to drive on its own since 2009 and their cars were able to drivemore than half a million miles without a crash or an accident occuring. The cars is not as independent as it should be. When the car need to back out of a driveway it alerts the driver to take over and while it is dealing with traffic issues when the road is busy and need help redirecting where to go when there is roadwork or an accident. The car is safe and smarter on the roads when stuff is not going on unexpectedly on the road.

The car can handling driving up to the speed of 25 miles per hour which requires the driver of the vehicle to still stay alert because the car can not do everything a regular car can when somebody is driving it. When the driver is not paying attention the driver's seat is able to vibrate and let the driver know when there is on coming traffic occuring or any problems. To also get the drivers attention The Google car can announce when the driver should prepare to take over. The car also flash its lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. If the driver is sleeping when the car is watching the road they also watch the driver and pay attention to the driver to keep the driver safe.

The car comes with a special sensor to keep the driver and the car itself safe earlier in the '80s automakers did make speed sensors to create antilock breaks and later on the same sensors became advanced to watch out and respond to the dangers on the road that would occur. The special touch sensor can also make sure the driver is keeping their hands on the wheel. BMW crweated the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" to help out the driver alittle bit when the driver is in need of help with this Google car.

The driverless cars are proved to be safe because it alerts you when situations occur unexpectedly, if you fall asleep or if you are not paying attention the car with vibrate all by itself that way you are alert and see everything that going on around you when you not paying attention, the car has driven for more than a million miles without a crash occuring or an accident, it drives up to a maximum or 25 miles per hour, and the car comes with a special touch sensor that senses things.

0e782a4,"Self driving cars. Everybody wants a car that can drive itself, but is it really practical? Many people say that self driving cars are a thing of the future, while others argue that they should not exist. Autonomous cars are not practical and should not be on the road because they are dangerous, impractical, and boringly monotonous.

Self driving cars are dangerous because they will not be able to sense or detect danger as wells as humans could. ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Cars are not safe under the care of automized vehicles due to the fact that there are too many variables and sporadic possibliltys when driving.

Now other than dangerous, they are also very impractical. Early forms of self driving cars such as ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" are examples of how impractical they are. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,"" this is a very slow speed and seems almost useless. Along with only going 25 mph self driving cars also require you to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"".

To add on to driverless cars being impractical, automated cars would make road trips very boring and dull. ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,"" admits Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW Project manager driver."" Taking road trips would be the only thing that comes mind when thinking of why you would need a driverless car, and then even road trips would become very repetitive and bland. ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" this shows that autonomous cars would take the fun out of taking road trips.

All in all, Autonomous cars are not the next big thing and are potentially a huge safety hazard. Driver assistance may be something that could be useful to drivers with impairments but driverless cars is taking it to the next level. Without roads to pair with these cars the use of driverless cars is impractical and not down to earth. So go out there and show your car some appreciation and give it a test drive, completely un-automated.",3

The planet humans live on, Earth, even has landforms that humans didnt make that just happen to look like faces, As Garvin says,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The face on Mars is nothing but land that has been formed in the shape of a face.

The amount of crashes that occur each year could decrease, because of the reckless driving that occurs and the amount of money we give to fuel taxes will also decrease tremendously. these smart cars will lessen the dangers on the road.

Making these driverless cars will not be cheap investment. All the technology and test practices to make this car 100% driverless will take time and will cost money. But all the time and money put into this project will be worth in in the end. This car will have far better responces and control than a human could ever accomplish by themselves.

0e82e35,"Aliens or a Coincidence?

I have a strong belief that the ""Face on Mars"" was a natural landform. I do not think that the face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility but there is no proof that would back up that statement. Although, the fact that that the face was a natural landform doesn't need much backup because it's something that naturally happens. The only difference is that it's not usually a face that is usually created.

How could aliens know what to make a face look like? And not just any face, a human face. As the caption noted, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I doubt that the aliens could make an exact replica of a human face because they have nothing to reference it off of.

Also, theres another question. How the face could have been made by aliens? What could the aliens possibly have made the face with? Im sure they would have required some tools to make this face on the planet of mars. Their hands would not be likely to complete that task because of what the planet is made of. The NASA didnt say they found any tools or objects that could be used as to make this ""face"".

Another doubt i have towards the aliens creating this face is what aliens? In the passage it said ""Manwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This implies that there is no civilization on Mars. So if there is no civilization on Mars, there is no one or nothing that could have made this face. How would they have made it if there is no one there to possibly make it?

There is reasoning I have to back up my opnion that it was a natural landform. Natural landforms happen here and there, almost everywhere. They come in any shapes and sizes. The form of a landform could be in any kind of shape. It's whatever it comes out to be. In this specific case though, the landform has captured the form of a face, somehow, with the correct facial features in the right places.

In the passage the ""Face of Mars"" is compared to the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" If there are other more specificly shaped landforms in the world, why cant it be one on mars? Theres no difference in the form that natural landforms come in. They all can come in any type of way. It doesn't make a difference where they're at or what they're made of. A natural landform is always going to be a natural landform.

In conclusion, I believe that the ""Face of Mars"" is a natural landform. There is no evidence disproving this statement. I do not believe that it was created by aliens. That was just an assumption that was made about the making of the ""face"".    ",4

0e86176,"The cars are coming, the cars are coming! The future of cars is said to be driveless cars. The future of cars in every kid's eyes were supposed to be flying cars or cars that travel back in time; however, our technology is nowhere near those vast advancements. Our next biggest step, to say blatantly, would be driverless cars.

Imagine a long day on the road and the driver needs a break; however, everyone else that's able to drive is asleep. So, the driver uses his driverless car so that he can sleep. Since no car has been proven to be one-hundred-percent driverless, the car notifies the driver that he needs to take the wheel. He doesn't catch the notice and they crash. According to the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,' ""..their cars have driven half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless."" This makes the cars dangerous.

Using the example above, someone may see that driverless cars are unsafe. In fact, the article even states, ""the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" In the article it also says that some scientists are said to believe that cars driven by humans are safer than these driverless cars. A lot of good things come with the car, unfortuantely one of those goods things is not safety.

0e8864c,"Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is unbelievably valuable.

Technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as ; Google Classroom, Edulastic, Khan Academy,and Mathia. The facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential. In the passage "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes Dr. Huang."". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.

Many parents or administrators may not agree that this sounds real or possible, but the logic is right before our eyes. In the text the author states how the technology performs the task of reading emotional appeals. For example, in paragraph 3 line 1 the author says,""The process begins when the com puter constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". So apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles. The author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the ; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more. This shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science.

So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education.",4

There's a revolution that stands before us in the form of a new lifestyle: Car-free living. Taking the globe by storm this global phenomenon presents us with a more efficient enviornment, a huge drop in car accident tragedies, and a more functionable lifestyle.

First and foremost, the given: a better enviornment. Air pollution is a global issue that has become very previlant in our society today. In places such as Paris, France, extremes as far as fines for those who drive around in cars are enforced as a way to fight it's overly dense smog. Also, the president of the United States, Barrack Obama, has set a goal to curb the greenhouse gas emissions in the country. When government iniative are set to such its obvious that it's becoming an issue. If everyone begins to enforce a car free lifesyle then the world will reach a tremendous turning point and will be able to preserve our planet for the future generations.

Furthermore, it is known that car accidents are a common occuring issue whether it be small or deadly. Intoxicated or sober accidents can be just as bad. There will be no more bikers or pedestrians being hit and need to hitch hike will no longer be an issue as well. If we remove cars form our lives then we get the advantage of putting our society in a more safe way to transport.

Finally, car free lving will make us a more functionable lifestyle. The need of having to go so far for simple things will no longer be an issue due to the fact that everything that would be essential would be easier and closer to assess. People would begin walking more which would very much so decrease the obesity rates in many places. Also the expanison of public transportation will mean that people are more likely to have a more direct stop near the places they go.

In sumation, living car-lessly is a life lived less carelessly. It brings a coupious amount of advantages which means that everyone will have a safer, more funcitonable, and efficient lifestyle.    ",3

This is seen in Paragraph 3,""Tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"". Even with NASA's sollution,the heat and the enviorment would not prevent that much harm with this sollution.

Some people might say that even with the condtions being risky, it is still survivable: ""Not easy condtions, but survivable,""(Paragraph 5). However Venus's weather and condtions can be very unpredictable. It would put peoples lives in danger not knowing what to predict. If NASA does have a sollution will it be able to be ready for unpredictable weather and conditions:"" additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface,""(Paragraph 3).

However some people might add that there are conditions on Venus that humans could survive, like solar power and less radation,(Paragraph 5). These things would be somewhat ""okay"" condtions for humans, with NASA's sollution in place.

That is why the exploration of Venus is so important, despite any and all dangers there are with doing so. Venus could be our stepping stone into a new era of exploration, pushing humanity into another golden era, or a renaissance.

The first reason that will be explained as to why we should explore Venus, despite its hostile environment and dangerous aspects, is that it tells us more about the planet itself and gives us insight to dealing with more challenging and dangerous scenarios in the future. Knowing how a planet works will always be beneficial to us and help in future space exploration, especially when the planet is our planetary neighbor in the solar system, and may have once held attributes similar to Earth's long ago. The similarities between the two planets pushes for exploration as Earth may one day end becoming like Venus and require a call for innovations to accomodate humans onto the planet. This speculation on the similarities also points to the question on whether or not there was once, or still is, water on Venus. This is because if there really has even been any form of water on Venus, then that next points to the question about life on Venus.

Venus's similarities to Earth don't stop, however, as Venus is at least now similar to Earth with its surface of rocky sediments, valleys, mountains, and craters. The rocky planet's formations and such have been found to be similar to those found very commonly on Earth, emphasizing on the theory that Venus may have once been similar to Earth, and if it can be helped to be restored. If this were possible, then it would make Venus a second hospitable planet for humans within the solar system making transportation easier than other planets as it is one of the closest planets to Earth, but cheaper as it would require less resources.

In the end, Venus should still at least be explored more thoroughly on its surface, and perhaps later underneath into the deeper undergrounds below if the technology ever becomes available, as this allows for potentially useful information to be gathered on the planet.",4

I was meaning to ask you can you please leave the electoral college. In way many people were grateful for this kind art education in many ways people use this place for so long to know how many scarefices that many people choose this area than no other. There got to be a diffrent reason to come in mind for can stop this idea from elimanating this fine place to construct for all years of hard work. For so long many people still would like to choose this college as great example for their success. This my letter to you senator. But if you refuse this than i don't know what i would do,but  what I do know is you choose what it came from your mind I can not stop you from picking the good or bad  choices but I can help you pick the right choice. As well making a election area that only happens in four years is not really worth anything many would disagree for this nonsense build and just forget what just came in mind and pick the right choice.                    ",1
0ea9cf8,"Hoping for a mere 538 people to vote for our nations president seems like an unfair way of voting. The Electoral College is a process of voting in which 538 electors vote for the new president for our nation, where 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Which ever elective has the most votes from states is the winner.

I believe that if the Electoral College was abolished, then we can have a more fair way of voting. Sure, The electoral college has some perks like a certainty of outcome, but there is more negatives on keeping it. If we got rid of the Electoral College for good and replaced it for a classic ""most-votes wins"" election then the nation can have a clear view to who their votes go to. This way, votes aren't decided by popular electoral votes.

The president should win over the most of our country with good qualitys that people want to see. People need to open their eyes and see ""When you vote for a candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" (Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College) If you vote for your favorite candidate you are voting for the state to win by popular vote. We should keep it simple. Add up everyones vote for whom they voted, and who ever has more votes wins.

""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.    ",3
0eaa4e4,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I'll narrow it down to two for you; People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.

First, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President; the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choosen by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the statre legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party; meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy (the president at the time) he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It's happen before, so who's to say that it won't happen again.

Second, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidental election off of Poplular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like Romney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the ""Terminator"" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.

0eaa56c,"Dear, to Miami senator. Americans should change election by popular vote for the president of the United State. The Electoral College it's not a good thing that is helping the citizens to express thier own thoughts in political. In Electoral College it's not really voting for the president it's for a slate of electors that turns elect the president. This shows that we the ""People"" that have the right to vote who we believe to be the leader for United States we are not really choosing him.

Additional, "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer shows "" the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". This can explain the Electoral College is ""unfair to voters because the winner take all system in each sate"" that means candidates can't spend time in each state getting their chance to win thier vote from the state for the next four years. However, electoral college ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candiate receives a majority of the votes cast"" shown in "" In defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the preseident"" by Richars A. Posner. This can help the candiates to not be a tied so the Electoral College reduced and thiers a clear winner. What if their was a tied would citizens like a machine take thier decision on who's going to be the leader of the United States ? I don't think so becasue a machine doesn't have a right to vote.

In therefore, in 2000 Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote. ""Over 60 percenet of voters would prefer a direct election ... this year voters can expect the popular vote win could again lose the presidency"" explain Plumer. This wasn't the voters decision was the Electoral College we should't have something that doesn't express our right of speech in political. However, the Electoral Collge ""process consists of the slection of the electors, they vote for President and Vice President"" this shows that the citizens can vote to be the most faithful President to be the leader on this opportunity land. To end, we shouldn't keep something that it's not really showing the voice of each citizens on this wonderful world we have as Ameica.

To conclude, we should change election by popular vote for the president of the United States. If we have a tie in the elctoral vote, ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president "" this explain we the citizens didn't chose the president would you like the citizens get mad a make a protest to chose the president ? American would like that so please senator take out the Electoral College becasue you never know if one day the citizens get as one to protest to get rid off the Electoral collge with their power of speech.                            ",3
0eb0013,"Driverless cars, I feel like its a disaster waiting to happen. As we exploring the world of cars and what they can teach us we will have a few bumps along the way. This is one of those bumps. Driverless cars will defeat the purpose of the 16 year old child earning freedom and driving on his or her own. It's not fair to the current generations that they won't be able to drive like past generations have.

If you pull text from the 8th paragraph it staes rather clearly that it's not really developed the way they wanted it. It's more like roadside assistance. But the driver would get rather bored waiting on his or her turn to drive, if they even get a turn. This is just one of the many negatives of driverless cars. The law in many states say that and driver needs to be present and in control but California, Flordia, Nevada and the District of Columbia are starting to allow it. People out there are starting to believe that it's the next great thing and that all the other states willl follow alot like the rise of homosexuality.

Now don't get me wrong the idea of a driverless cars seems pretty cool and the world would love the change but is it worth it? Think of the thousands of taxi drivers and limo drivers that would be out of work. Think of the people that work at the BMWs, they would be out of jobs and wouldn't be able to provide for the families they have. Is it all worth the unemployment line filling us in busy towns because the cabs have no reason to be driven?

The passage also allows the reader to wonder what would happen if the car malfunctioned. Would it be the drivers fault or the companies fault? This could simply be avoided and that makes lives alot easier and even though you have to go through task of teacher the newer generations to drive wouldn't that be eaier than taking and risk and possibly dying beacuse you wanted to use a driverless car.

The passage also states they've already got a phase A of the driverless car. Google has presented a car that can drive up to 25 miles per hour with no issues until it needs help swearving throughout traffic. Then and only then will the driver be able to control the car. Other than that the car is just a no driver needed car unless a situation happens. This also could upset the driver because they might've wanted to drive but they have to wait his or her turn to control the car. This could also cause many issues and it's a huge possiblity that the car accident rate can and will increase because of the malfuntions of the car.

In short this passage can be connceted to Surealism. This whole idea is a figure of someone's imagination and they thought it would be rather cool to eleminatedivers as jobs. Think of the taxi and limo drivers they will lose jobs if people have driverless cars. It also defeats the purpose of maing the world a btter place because now there will be homeless people and people needing jobs that aren't avalible to them. Do you really think that this sureal idea is the best idea they could come up with?",4
0eb2865,"To whom it may concern,

The growing debate on whether or not the electorial college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electorial college is vitial to the presidential election process becuase it evens out the importance of all the states' votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for toss-up states to vote for the best candiate.(Posner) It can be precieved that the electorial college is a non-democratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people becuase the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electorial college has been around for decaades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come?

The electorial college should be kept becuase it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electorial college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote becuase they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.(Posner) Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty.

Many of the time voters will vote becuase they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electorial college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate becuase they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.(Posner) With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the toss-up staes chose them over the other.

A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electorial college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electorial college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections.

The electorial college is vitial when chosing the presdient becuase it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electorial college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electorial college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electorial college is the best for the president's elections.

Sincerely,

0eb8d11,"Technology in modern day is advancing in leaps and bounds, and one of the areas people are most interested in is transportation. People are constantly looking to make their commute faster, easier, and more fun. Safety is a main concern for many, and society is looking to create fatality-free roads. As such, driverless cars are the ultimate goal for our society. There are many pros and cons to such a thing, and the risks far outnumber the gain at least for the time being.

Many poeple argue that automated cars would be safer than a human driver. People are subject to risks such as distraction, drunk driving, and human error while machines are immune to such ailments. An automated car can safely navigate under certain conditions, and when a threat is apparent that the car cannot handle on its own, a human can take over. For several years, cars have been built with systems such as automatic brakes and other automated features that can assist the driver or fully take over the car. Traction control brakes sense when a car is sliding and stop it even if the person behind the wheel doesn't realize that they are in danger. With successful technology like this, people assume that making cars fully automatic would increase the safety. People would even get the chance to relax while in the car. Trips that formerly took a week or more could be made in days if the car could drive itself while the human driver slept. It would also be possible for people to do things such as work or watch television while in the car, things that previously would cause incredible danger.

While there are many benefits to fully automated cars, there are also risks that come with the technology. First of all, the technology does not even exist yet, and it is unclear when it will. For now, cars are only partially automated and fully automated cars would need a certain set of requirements to be met in order to function properly and safely. The amount of sensors needed to achieve full automation is astounding. It would take several different kinds of sensors including cameras, radar, and many more. Some of these need magnets or radio signals while on the road to function, so if an anomaly occured that put them out of commission, things could go terribly wrong. The cost of such things is incredibly high. The car in and of itself would cost much more than the same model without automation. Tax payers would be required to pay for installing magnets or other feedback technology on roads so the cars would have enough information to function properly, and people could fall into debt for the luxury of an automated car.

In the year 2016, automated cars are a dream that is far too dangerous and costly to pursue. Years in the future, it may be an innovation bringing safety and comfort to hudreds of people, but in the present it is impossible. The cost of installing the necessary technology for such cars to function would delve too far into taxpayers' pocketbooks to be truly profitable, and the technology would need replaced every few years anyway. If something were to malfunction in just one car, it could cause mass chaos and death or injury to potentially hundreds of people. At this point in time, the technology has too much risk to be possible in the near future.",4
0ebb30a,"In German life goes on without a car and for some of us that wouldnt be too easy. Just think how much money they save for not paying for gas,car payments and parking places,plus if you dont have a car its always good to ride a bike or walk somewhere. And 75% sold there car just to move here. Its easier for citys to walk and drive around somewhere. Its easy now to get where you need to go if you walk because they made stores close by so you can walk to them.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If you had a even or odd license plate one day you werent aloud to drive that day you had to wait. But some people did not follow this rule about 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after having some of the people not drive and after five days of intensifying smog. Cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap in car emissions. What they are doing is really good because this could help people not drive as much.

Bogota,Colombia people hiked,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third straight year cars have been banned. Only buses and taxis were allowed for work and transportation. Even when it had rained they didnt care they still kept walking. Parks,Sport centers and shopping stores have gotten alot better because of the people walking. For a very first time Colombian cities ,Cali and Valledupar joined this event too.1990's is when they started a day without cars in Bogota.

Trying to make less people drive now a days. President Obama's goals is to curb the united states greenhouse gas,it says americans are buying fewer cars ,fewer licenses and driving each year. The kids now a days dont really care about driving too much or care to even get a license. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent bewtween 2001 and 2009. The number of people driving now has gone down from the miles on the cars. Mercedes and Ford are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.            ",1
0ec99dd,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile ,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now for this techology to be used in the classroom I have mixed feelings on weather this is appropriate to use. In the other hand it could potentially increase the student body to be more compatiable with being in school and truly enjoying the enviorment and space that they are in. Due to the fact that the teachers know how the students feel or mentally react to on what is happining.

The reason that I feel that this should not be used in school is the fact that it violates all of the personal and private feelings of a student and the lack of emotions it can tell, According to the text it states "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger , disgust, fear and sadness"". There are more emotions than that. One out of the six actually represent something good and happy the other five are more on the sad and unhappy emotions. Another quote from this article states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". If that is true then there would no point in for an emotion to tell you how they truly feel. There is nothing better than another warm blodded person with emotions aswell to say something such as hey i can understand what your going through I feel the same way you didn't have to tell me but I knew.

On the other side of the spectrum and saying how this could benifit the students and the teachers is how to make the class or more engaging to the students. As stated in the article "" "" A classroom computer could recpgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" "" That could help a lot of students especially the ones eho normally dont like school. Plus this machine will potentially make you happier stated in the article "" The Mona Lisa demonstration is realy intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much this computer can do."" This coul help people with persay deppresion and confusion on making a choce or big decision on something.

This manchine the "" Facial Action Coding System"" could help with you arround your freinds or a crush/ significant other on how they truly feel twoards something. Aswell as trying or attempting to make them feel better. In the article stated it sites "" For instance, you could probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"" This could say help the autistic kids who cant read emotions or conversation ques, and understand them so they dont hurt somebodys feelings. Furthermore, the text states "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them. "" Doing so could help your freind whos having a bad day have a happier one or a loved one because thinking and trying to be happy will actually make you happy.

In conclusion in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I have personaly mixed emotions about this being used in schools as seen. Then again my overal feel of this is posiitive and sholud be regulated within schools. Due to how this may impact the teaching area and enivorment to best help the student or just a person in general.",5

0ed8aad,"It seems that technology gets upgraded yearly. Recently, Apple has created a software called Animoji. This software allows you to have an emoji replicate your facial actions. This ties into the new software, the Facial Action Coding System. This software analyzes your face and can tell you how much percent happiness, anger, sadness, fear, suprise, or even disgusted you are displaying. Since we already have facial recognition, why not have the software to tell you your mood. This software would benefit education and provide a safer area for students through recognizing extreme signs of depression or anger.

Our mood can either help or damage our learning processes in school. If you are in a bad mood, you will not care as much as you would if you were happy. This software would be very benificial for any classroom. Having this software could help students learn. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huand predicts. Then, the software could modify the lesson to suite the students need. This software could boost the students grades, because the students would be more focused or not get confused due to the Facial Action Coding System. Not only will the software boost the students education, it could also help the school identify if someone is extremely depressed or angry. This software could prevent anything drastic from occurring. It could prevent suicide, shootings, fights and all sorts of things. It could save someones life, if not many peoples lives.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System can benefit our education and learning processes in numerous ways. It can recognize when a student is confused, and then it could modify the lesson to help the student understand the topic. It could also recognize when a student is bored, and then modify the lesson to be more interesting. It could improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely depressed. It could also improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely angry. The shool could then help the students who are depressed or angry to prevent anything drastic from happening. These are several reasons to how the Facial Action Coding System could benefit education and provide a safer area for students through recognizing extreme signs of depression or anger.",3
0edb7ff,"That one person, having the overall say in the United States. The U.S. has ever four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November elections to determine our leader. the process or system that takes place now is the Electoral College votiong system where people elect electors to vote on the President your state discides on. I disfavor the Electoral College system, because of the overall fairness.

Planning the future, the College of Electoral system has a ""lack of democratic pedigree."" Having things change for the worse the states elect all their trust into a elector that may not vote for the president the states civilians want. Then the ratio to the amount of civilians to the number of electoral votes are off. ""Wyoming represent 500,000 voters, would have much  say as thee 55 representatives from Califormia, who represent 35 million voters."" Voters have to realize that their political prefrence will not make as much difference in the Electoral College, than in the popular vote. If the population of voters want a certain President, then it makes sense to have him elected. It has the same concept as the ""winner take all"" system, but their will be no faith in an elector that may confuse his purpose of votes.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of might having the states with no candidates to cast their votes. Also making the President visit certain states with a enormous amout of voters and try to win their votes. This make the President learn about the conflicts of the states and what their problem is to try and compromise it. Some people prefer to have elector, because they want to have a political prefrence. In a proportional manner with equal input into the election, the future would have to change making it popular vote wins. In the point of view of other civilians, other people from other regions may feel disenfranchised. Then segregationist will be equal in input taking out the favortism.

December is now here and the elector will vote in a new President. The rules of electing an offical leader may change, but the proccess of being offical doesn't. The President must first prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" witch causes the President to record all the people and information involving in the election. This is for the record of the Congress and National Archives. The proccess of election should change, because of the overall fairness of the amount of voters to electoral votes. This democratic pedigree will give everyone an equallity to voters and amount of input.    ",3

0ee0e5c,"In the passage the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea because it shows us the positive side as well as the negative side. For example a positive thing is Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. It is also the closest in distance too. Despite all the dangers Venus has the author wants us to examine and study the benefits and the challenges Venus has for all of us.

Here in Earth we are used to the atmospheric pressure and the amount of carbon dioxide we encounter on earth. The quote ""On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees fahreinheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

shows us how a negative thing is that those conditions are way more extreme than what us humans contribute to on earth. Meaning that we would not survive in Venus in those conditions. Another thing is that Venus has a way more hotter surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. This shows us how even though mercury is closet to the sun, even venus has a hotter temperature which to us that is dangerous. More over high pressure and heat, the venus weather presents additional inpediments such as erupting volcanoes,strong earthquakes,and most likely lightning strikes.

Scientists are discussing further visits to Venus. As well as astronomers think that there might have been a possibility that in venus it may well once have been the planet that has been more earth-like planet in our solar system. The quote ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth."" shows us how Venus one day could have became a planet just like earth and have life. Which is a positive thing because today venus still has some features that are similar to those on earth. Some of those characteristics that venus has similar to earth are valleys,mountains,and craters. In the future this could be a recall that venus can one day be a safe option for a planetary visit,space travel,and maybe one day it can have life.

The NASA has an idea for sending humans to study venus but could that really be a safe plan? There plan to the rare conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above. The quote ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahreinheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth."" shows us how those would not be easy conditions for humans to travel and be survivable too. This is a risk that humans have but scientists are telling us to look at them as challenges and not risks. Which could be a negative thing.

In conclusion the author explains the negatives and positives that Venus has for us in the future and today. There can be risks but if they find a way for us to be safe, everything will be okay. Human curiosity will lead us into many new adventures in the future. Our travels on earth and beyond shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but lead us into the safest way possible.

0ee7d80,"Can you imagine in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? I cannot imagaine a future like this. I see a future where we all learn to drive safely and without pollutuion. I do not believe that driveless cars are good for the future because pollution may increase. Also with drivers not needing to drive could cause more accidents. And expenses will increase on buying the driverless cars.

The first reason a future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore is a bad idea is because people won't want to learn driver safety. If we make cars that drive on their own why would someone want to read or learn how to actually drive? With cars that doesnt require you to focus on a road people will text, play games, talk to other passengers in the car and not even realize what's going on on the road. Without driver safety people will question why we need driver tests.

My second reason a future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore is a bad idea is because accidents could occur more often than usual. With the need to not pay attention to the road people will be more likely to roughhouse within the car or argue over who can sit in the front seat. Everyone knows, technology fails from time to time, if we allow these cars to be made then what does the driver do if the car malfunctions? Drivers and passengers will not see the need to wear a seatbelt because they believe that the driverless car will keep them safe because machines can't make ""human error"".

My final reason a future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore is a bad idea is because expenses will increase on buying cars. With the way the economy is who is to say that everyone will be able to afford a car with such technology? The way that families and jobs are it is not to say that a person may have enough money in the budget to buy these cars. If they we to buy the car how will they get the money to recieve this veihcle? Saving, the people will save all their money so once they buy the car the will be broke and it will be even harder to keep a house or food on the table or even to wash their clothes.

So to conclude. The reasons why I believe a future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore is a bad idea is because driver safety will be ignored. Accidents will occur more often. And Expenses will be to much for the people.",3
0ef4f4f,"Driverless cars should continued to be developed and improved. The driverless car has such a bright future. Think of a world were there would be no car crashes or long lines of traffic due to an accident. The driveless car could do that for the world. If the driverless car is continued to be improved, who knows one day it may not need a driver at all. Even if it never gets to that point theere are still many positives to this car. There would be a large decrease in the number of accidents due to the fact that people wouldn't have to text and drive or be on their phones at all while drive. This car could change the way of driving as we know it.

The technology of this car could improve to where there would be no need for a driver at all. In this case, the world of driving would be dramatically different from the one today. They amount of accidents would probably be cut down to almost zero and the amount of lives saved from this would amazing. This would happen due to the fact that human error would be taken out of the driving world. There would be no accidents due to drinking, not paying attention, or cell phone use. The amount of time waiting in long lines of traffic would be none existant because there wouldn't be any accidents to hold up traffic in the first place. Even if for some reason there was traffic you could just pass the time by taking a nap or something of that nature because you would need to contistly pay attention to what is going on. The world with completely driverless car would improve the daily lives of the people.

Nevertheless, even if this technology never reaches this point completely the driveless car is still a step in the right direction. The driverless car that isn't completely driverless can still decrease the amounts accidents just not to almost zero. This driverless car can still cut down the accidents do to not paying attention and cell phone use. Since this driverless car cuts down the amount of accidents there will be less chances for traffic but in some cases traffic will occur.

This driverless car still improves the daily lives of people just not to the same exstint as the completely driverless car.

The driverless car is a step in the right direction. Weather it be the driverless car or completely driverless car, they have to start somewhere. As technology improves so will these cars and one day they maybe able to drive themselves completely but to be able to get to that point that need to continue to develope this idea so that it can get to its full potiental. The future for this car is very bright and could change the world as we know it.",4

Someone shouted,""Why are you here?""

I closed my eyes and prepared my speech, here goes nothing. ""My name is Luke Bomberger and I'm am here, gentlemen, to persuade you to join in a program called the Seagoing Cowboys program.""

There was a hushed silence as I finished my proposal. I could see the looks of confusion on many peoples' faces. I'm off to a good start.

After a few seconds there was mumbling in there was mumbling in the crowd.

""What's that mean?"" Someone shouted.

""What do we do in it?"" Another chimed in.

There were multiple questions being fired in my direction and I was starting to get a headache.

""Lower your voices!"" I shouted as I raised my hands in a stop gesture,""I can't answer your questions when you guys are being so loud.""

Finally th crowd calmed down.

One young man pushed himself to the front of the stage where I was and asked, ""What do we do if we join the program?""

I was prepared for this question and replied,"" Well, in this program you have to help take care of the animals, like horses and young cows, to cross the oceans.""

I felt like that sentence didn't have enough information, so I added,""World War II has ended and we need to assist other countries that have been affected by the war.""

""WIll it be boring?"" One man asked from the back of the crowd. All eyes were on me, their gazes intent on what I was about to say.

I stopped and mulled over my thoughts before answering,""Well, not really. You would be able to see other countries and their landscapes, but you would have to clean the stables and feed the animals. When they are returned to their destination, on the return trips you can have a lot of fun. I had played some sports like baseball and table-tennis with the other boys who had join during one trip back to America.""

The crowd looked interested. I felt like I had said the important parts to persuade them.

""Is it dangerous?"" One person said.

""It can be at time when it's raining extremely hard on deck."" I admitted.

I thought I needed to say more, so I added,""All the adventures you can have will be exciting, but one thing this program has helped me be aware of is the people of other countries and their needs. I played my part in assisting others, will you do the same?""

There was excited murmmuring as everyone surged forward. I felt pride in what I had said.

""I want to join!"" Someone shouted.

""Where do I sign up?"" Another one asked.

I allowed a smile to appear on my face as I pointed to the left. ""You can sign up over there.""      ",2

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a group of people that help countries that have been in World Wars recover food, supplies, animals and more. The other members and I do so many cool things in the program! If you were to join you could do these cool things with us. So you should think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy program is an opportunity of a lifetime. While traveling you can see many landmarks or historical sites. Maybe we could see the Great Wall of China sometime! You could meet many new people in the world. Oversea you could learn many new languages like Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and many more.

If your in a Seagoing Cowboys program you could visit many cool places. You could see the Great Wall of China or even The Acropolis in Greece. While being in the program I've been to the Acropolis in Greece and I've ridden in a Gondola in the streets of Venice, Italy. You could visit landmarks and even statues of historical figures.

After delivering the animals and food we clean everything up then we have a bunch of free time. In our free time we play baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to help pass time. We play all these things in the cleaned out stables of the animals. We all have fun! If you were to join us I bet you would have a bunch of fun too.

In conclusion, joining the Seagoing Cowboys is fun, friendly, and fantastic! We help many people but we have fun at the same time. Everyone in the program right now is having fun. I would love to see all of you join the Seagoing Cowboys. Hope to see you sign up soon!         ",3
0f01b9a,"Cars are a very, very common mode of transportation used all over the world. People depend on cars to get them from place to place every single day. While driving cars seem to be the quickest and easiest form of transportation, there are negative sides to it. These negative effects can be harmful to the environment and humans if we aren't careful. Therefore, citizens should take a step forwards limiting their car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle.

When cars are used, they can pollute the air with harmful chemicals and toxins. Air pollution is a serious issue that is occuring around the globe. This is important because cars are polluting the air we need in order to survive. Some cities around the world have gotten so polluted that they had to restrict people from using cars over a period of time to try and cleanse the air. If you drove during the ban, then you would recieve a fine. Paris and Bogata are two cities that particitpated in the ban. After the pollution cleared up some, the ban was lifted in both cities. Therefore, reducing the air pollution is a major advantage to not using your car as much.

Over time, cars can use up a lot of resources. Cars run on gasoline, which is a fossil fuel. There is only so much of it and once it's gone, it's gone. Our fossil fuels are being used up quick, so it's time to start saving them. You can save resources by driving around less. Instead of driving yourself, you could either walk, ride a bicycle, skate, ride a bus, or car-pool with some friends. These are all ways you could help save the planet's resources.

Lastly, limiting how much you drive your car can be beneficial because it is a healthier lifestyle for you. You could get more excerise and help the environment at the same time. One community in Germany, named Vauban, gave up their cars completely. They are in a movement called ""smart planning."" This community gets around by walking or riding bicycles. Their lifestyle includes having stores and markets a walk away so they have easier access to them. Having a healthier lifestyle is an advantage because it's important to take care of yourself.

The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle. Driving less reduces smog because it helps clean the air from toxins. It also helps save the limited amount of fossil fuels that we have. Not to mention, driving your car less will give you a chance to live a healthier lifestyle because you will get much more excercise. Overall, driving less is beneficial to both humans and the environment. Therefore, join the movement and limit your car usage.    ",4
0f0fc7a,"In the last few years vehicle emissions have been heating and even destroying our atmosphere. Cities and even whole countries are taking precautions to lower the amount of fuel emissons recorded in the air. It's not only that people are trying to cut back to help the enviroment they just arent driving as much anymore for some reason, even in areas that driving would be more useful than other forms of transportation. You may want to cut back after seeing why they did too.

In Germany there is a suburban city that has given up their use of vehicles. One of the local residents stated ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" You may not notice it but the hustle and bustle of everyday life and commuting may just be putting more stress on you. Cutting out personal commute will not only be making your life less stressful it will also help clear the air in some cities as well. Passenger cars are responsible for nearly 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in car intensive areas in the United States. Something as simple as not driving as often or cutting back totaly can help you and others.

In Bogota, the capital of Colombia it has been the third straight year of

Day Without Cars. Day Without Cars is one day that all Colombians hike,bike,skate,walk or took public tranportation to get to work. The goal of

Day Without Cars is to promote alternative transportation and reduce fines. A citizen talking part in the action stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Now in America it has been recorded that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting less licences each year. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and have been slowly and steadily dropping after. Transportation is is the second largest source of emissions but you can help lower that. More and more people have been choosing alternative transportation than ever before. Also more people have left the sub-urban enviroment and moved to urban ones so alternative transportation is even more needed than before. Also whats the point of driving if you live near the place you work cutting down on emissions is one of the most important objectives right now.

Many great things can and have come by cutting down private transportation. It conserves resources, cuts down on emissions, and also improves safety. Multiple people say that commuting less has made thier lives less stressful than ever before. The amount of smog in cities have decreased, helping to get cleaner natural air those compact areas. Anything you can do to help make your lives easier you should and cutting down on emissions can help make that easier.                ",3

0f18dcd,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future. There is no doubt that they are comming and comming fast, but I do not believe that there will be totaly driverless in my lifetime. There would be many required updates to the curent roads. Along with the roads, laws would have to be updated as well.

I do not believe that driverless cars are the best kind of cars for these reasons.

Although there have been many good improvements on the modern car, such as seat belts and air bags, I do not think that driverlessness will be one of them. They have created many improvements to the driverless cars, but they are still not totaly driverless. A machine can not take place of a human. Even though driverless cars have all the technology needed to drive on the average road, they still need help to get in or out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues. The car cannot stear itself thorugh roadwork or accidents. What is the point of a driverless car if it cannot drive itself?

Another reason the driverless cars are a thing of the future and not of the now is because there would require far too many updates to the current road system. I do not think that it would be safe if there was a mixture of driverless and non-driverless cars on the same road. What if a driverless ""'driver'' did not the warning to take over soon enough and ran into an non-driverless car. Whos fault would it be? The ""driver'' or the manufacturer. I do not think that driverless cars are in our best intrest because of all the updates they would require.

Another update required would be law updates. I think that if we went to driverless cars we would have to make everyone switch to driverless cars. If they work how the article clames, like a public-transport taxi system, than it would put a lot of public transportation workers out of buisness. I live in Indiana, on of the many states that do not allow test computer-driven cars. If our state won't even test them, then how are we suppost to know if we can trust them. I do not think that driverless cars would work for us because we do not live in a city. This would not be practical because in my town we do not use taxis, so why would we have access to driverless cars?

I do not think that driverless cars are in our best intrest because they are not totaly driverless. They would also require too many updates to our roads and our laws. Driverless cars may be a think of the future, but not the near future. ",4
0f1ab9c,"I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea. They have the potential to be very beneficial but there are many complications. Driverless cars are expenzive, cause liability issues, and may not be 100% safe for all of the passengers.

Driverless cars have many parts to them. They contain lots of technology and different types of sensors, a GPS receiver and a camera near the rearview mirror. Self driving cars require all of these things and more in order to be able to drive around the same skill level as a human driver and to be semi-driverless. All of the technology required to build these cars will make the cost of these cars very high and not very affordable.

Technology is not fool proof, and neither are humans. Both make mistakes and legally you would have to be able to answer the question of whether or not the person in the car that is ""driving"" is the one at fault in an accident, or if it is the fault of the technology and the manufacturer. At the moment, these cars are only semi-autonomous and require a human to be in the car and ready to take over in case problems arise. If the driver isn't able to avoid an accident because of the cars technology, then who's fault is the accident?

Safety is another important concern. Will fully autonomous cars be able to react quickly enough to prevent an accident that a human could have avoided? I think that semi-driverless cars are a better idea than fully driverless cars as technology can fail or malfunction and that can put all of the passengers in the car in a dangerous situation. Having an alert human driver that is able to control the car at any point and time would be important for the safety of the passengers.

I do not think that having cars that can drive completely by themsleves is a good idea. It would be very expensive and they would not be available to everyone because of cost problems. There is always going to be oppurtunity for the failure of technology in these cars and that can cause not only liability and legal issues, but would also raise saftey concerns for those riding in them.

The future holds many new advancments. And as stated in the text, ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" It's been a making in the works for years. Now the dream is finaly coming into sight. Driverless cars are becoming more and more pluasable.

There is a lot of sensor and equipment that go into making these cars safe. So much, in fact, that these cars may be safer than actual drivers themself. The high tech gadgets attached to the car help it ""see"" it's surroundings and drive safely. The farther advanced the reaserch goes, the safer and more reliable this technology will get.

Some may say that these driverless cars are not the future. They say it's to dangerouse or to expensive or to advanced. While it is expensive, driverless cars are still the furure. They are very safe, in some cases safer than an actual driver. The technology is not to advanced, it's being studied and develped every day. The technology is right in front of our eyes. The driverless car is the future.

Some say that driverless cars will be the future to public transportation, but others think that dirverless cars should be illegal even to test on roads. The development of driverless cars should be illegal.

Google has had cars that could drive indepently but under very specific conditions. Google's driverless cars are not truely driverless. These cars still require a driver to navigate in and out of driveways and if there is complications in traffic such as contructions sites. The driver must stay alert at all time is complications are ahead of them.

For some smart cars there must be electrical cables sending signals to the car. But without the opition of smarter roads manufacturers how will the car sense what is ahead? The manufactors would have to install more motion sensors, which requires more money and time that people do not have. Humans are far better off to control the car, rather the car control them.

The driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Lawmakers know the right way to get the alert the drivers if something is happening ahead. Most traffic laws are written with the conclusion that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. For most states it has been illegal to even test ccomputer-driven cars.

Though some people believe that driverless cars should be legal to develop and drive.Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions that the driverless cars will be the future of public transportation. The use of driverless cars can decrease the use of gasoline and can be less harmful to the community. If driverless cars become popular there will be less accidents. Yet the people would still have to navigate the cars into or out of driveways and through construction sites.

0f22798,"Many people go through many different emotions throughout their day. They show their emotions with facial expressions which also let's other people around them know what their current feelings could be. Although some people's expressions are hard to read due to them not showing emotion in their face or hiding it,they can go through a process in a computer system named 'Facial Action Coding System' in other words FACS ,which makes the computer determin their feeligs. This is also a good system for when historians are trying to figure out old pantings like The Mona Lisa. This computer system can work well because it determins a persons feeling,it can help make better computer-animated faces more expressive,and it can help modify a teaching lesson according to the student liking.

First the computer system can tell what a person's feelings are. In paragraph four it read ""By weighting the different units,the software can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared againts a neutral face"". Another example can be found in paragraph five, it talks about how the computer software stores simliar codes to figuring out emotions and also talks about Da Vinci studing human anatomy to help him paint human facial expressions. These two examples show somewhat how the computer system works and how effective it when it comes to facial expressions.

Secondly FACS can help develope better computer-animated facial expressions. In paragraph six it read ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery"" Another example is found in paragraph three when the author talks about 3-D computer models of the faces. He also talks about the muscles used when we make an expression. This two examples can show how FACS can help figuring out which facial expression is used and how to demonstrate it more strongly.

Lastly FACS can help figuring out lessons based on the students facial expression. In paragraph six it said ""A classroom computer cpu;d recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor. Another example is found in paragraph four when the author talks about individuals showing vary degrees of expression making it hard to tell exactly what they feel. This examples show that knowing a students main emotion to a lesson can help modify a special lesson making them enjoy it better and learning more.

In conclusion FACS can be very usual when it comes to determening and knowing exacly one's feeling. It can also be useful when historians need to figure out emotions people felt during erlier times based on a panting. FACS also can show the many different moods a persons facial expression can contain. FACS will be used when determining a persons feeling,makeing better computer-animated faces more expressive,and help modify a teaching lesson according to the student liking.",3
0f2299f,"The use of this technology (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because it has evidence that it works on facial expression on what peoples emotions are.

Also ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions, hapiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

It is valuable in a classroom because it can prevent bullying, by showing the teachers what students are feeling if they are sad or angry about something and it can prevent school shootings with students who have ""emotional"" problems or have thoughts about harming others, basically it can prevent alot of things happening in school n can help students cope or think about hoe they are feeling to effect what type of day they might have.

0f247b7,"I believe that driverless cars are pointless. They aren't really driverless, there are laws in some states against testing driverless cars, the traffic laws are written assuming that it is most safe to have a human driving the car & you don't know who will be to blame if an accident or something goes wrong.

Driverless cars aren't fully driverless. The driver still has to take over when pulling in and out of driveways & dealing with complicated traffic issues. For example, navigating through roadwork or an accident. What's the point of having a driverless car, when you still have to be alert and paying attention? People want a driverless car so they don't have to do any work.Many people don't pay attention sometimes or get distracted while driving. This a dangerous disadvantage. The driver could be distracted and get into an accident because they weren't paying attention and didn't take over the car when they needed to.

The laws for driving rely on an alert driver to achieve safety while driving. Today, traffic laws are written assuming that the only way a car is safe is if it has a human driver in control at all times. In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.Manufacturers hope that more states will allow them if they are proven to be more safe. However, if there is an accident involving a driverless car who will be to blame the manufacturer or the driver?

Driverless cars also require a lot of sensors to mimic the controls of a human driver.Google's modified Toyota Prius uses sensors on the left rear wheel. on the roof, a video camera near the rear view mirror, four radar sensors, GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.

All of the sensors could malfunction and something could go wrong with the car. Having to rely on all of the sensors to work correctly isn't very safe.

I believe that driverless cars should not be used now, in the future, or ever. If you have a driverless car, they aren't driving themselves they are just assisting you. There are also many things that could go wrong with the driverlass cars also.Technology isn't always reliable, and could not work at any time.I think that there are too many disadvantages to having a driverless car.

This is about calculating emotions on a three D computer.

First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. there is this three D computer that can take calculations on your emotions and tell you if you are truly happy or hiding your real emotions.

secendly, theres ba computer that contructs a three-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move around like the human muscles. there are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness the three-D computer can detect all six of these emotions and calculate the emotions and tell you how you really feel. you can tell when someone is truly smiling because there muscles in there face move a serten way and if it is a fake smile your muscles move a different way therefore you can tell if the smile is fake or not.

0f3483e,"Cars that drive them selfs well that sounds a lot easier than having to drive everywhere youself. If cars could drive themselves there would be a lot of pressure lifted off of people. For the fact we dont want to crash or get pulled over, the simple stuff like that. After all there still would be areas were humans would have to handle depending on how smart they make the cars. It would be nice to just sit and be able to look around while the car drives itslef and im not the only one to think that.

First, say you were going on a long road trip you could finally pay attention to the view for the fact your not the one whos driving so you could stare out the window and admire the view. Being able to see things you havent been able to see befor for the silly fact tha you were driving and had to pay attention to the road. There might be times were you have to take the wheel because of where you are and how many other vehicles are around, but you could always get back to admiring the view anytime. Say you had to wait in traffic you wouldnt be the one to have to do it because your not driving. There are a lot of good reasons to let the vehicle do the work for you.

Second, if the wehicle is high tech enough were it could sense danger or out of control skids or rollovers then you could feel more safe knowing youll be safe. Driving safe is a huge part of driving period if the vehicle can do that on its own without fail then you can do what you need in the vehicle like maybe text or call and still feel safe. Eventually the vehicles will become smart enough were it can do almost anything a person could do so it could handle more driving tasks on its own. So far the cars arent fully developed to where the vehicle is completely driverless. The in car system is actually a safety feature and safety is a huge concern.

Last, in the near future cars will be a lot more efficient and safer to get around in. There will be aguments about these vehicles. The point is the future is near and we are becoming a lot more advanced in technology. To move forward we need to create inventions tha no one has thought about weather they like it or not. Eventually everyone will get used to the idea.

The fact is we have a long way to go before the cars can truly do what we want. It is ahead of us eventually we'll see things we never thought we would. We have to keep moving forward with ideas like this brilliant one. Every step we take we keep pushing toward the idea of driverless cars and we will get there.",4

0f393ae,"Cars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages; the planet would grealty benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.

Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal,

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates"" (Rosenthal). One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many peole are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcemnt was that congestion (or smog) went down 60 percent. This is a great improvemnt for the city, which is known for having near-record pollution. Multiplying these enforcemnts to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.

The cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article,

Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a care-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky). With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rush-hour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one's destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.

People become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in

Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.

Although cars are useful in order to get to one's destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.    ",5
0f4a9a2,"Driverless cars really are not such a thing of the future anymore. They are here and they are improving to imitate human driving abilities, but are we humans so sure that we want them? I mean, sure the driverless car seems so convienient and everything, but if you still have to pay attention to the road then what is the point? Driverless cars may seem great, but they truly are not.

So many teenagers are foaming at the mouth practically to get there license when they turn 16, and some people just love to drive in general. They would not want to be driven around by a computerized car. Driving yourself around is a passion for some people. I personally do not think driverless cars should be a thing. Technology is always getting bigger and smarter, but will it truly be smart enough to simulate the thought process of a human brain in a bad situation while driving? It does not seem very likely. While there are many pros to driverless cars, there are also cons. One of the main cons that comes to mind when I think of a driverless car is the safety of it. I mean sure, they may be proven to be safe, but almost all technology messes up at somepoint. How can the creators of driverless cars say that they are completely safe. For all they know there could be an unknown glitch in their server and it could cause the car to crash and the driver to die. Also, in the article they said they use a lot of sensors and radars to simulate that of the human vision. What if one accidentally broke or malfunctioned, but continued to drive seemlessly without error? As mentioned in the article, the driver could be using one of the entertainment systems that they build into the car to occupy the driver while the car is self-driving; consequently, they may neglect to see a car in front of them and crash because they were distracted by the entertainment system, and then there is a possible human life lost. Who would be at fault then? Would the company that made the car be responsible? Or how about the driver who was distracted by the car's entertainment systems? No matter who is at fault for the wreck, the wreck could have possbile been avoided if there was a human driver behind the wheel. These are jsut a couple of the many safety concerns that come with the possibility of driverless cars. While they may be advanced, futuristic vehicles, they seriously be thought about before trusting a human's life with them; consequently, I think they should be kept off of the roads until they are proven 100% safe.

I really do not think driverless cars are a good idea until they can prove that the technology that goes into them will run 100% error free and not malfunction. Until that happens they should not allow them on the roads just for the sake of human lives being at risk. All it could take is a single crash, and while I know that hasn't happened yet, it is bound to and a human life will be lost; therefore, I say keep them off of the roads. Driverless cars are not for us until we can prove that they will not glitch or mess up and crash.    ",4
0f4fadf,"The article "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" is about a boy named Luke Bomberger. His friend Don Reist invited him to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew it was an opportunity of a life time. To help these countries recover their food suplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)

In 1945 the UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On

August 14 1945 Luke and Dom headed for greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus. In 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The Cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

I think that being a "" Seagoing Cowboy"" will be fun and adventurest. As you travel on the cattle boat you will be able to visit unique and amazing places. You will also have fun while you are doing it. You will also be able to experence lots of thing that most others can not. As your doing these fun and exsiting stuff you will also be helping those recovering countries in need of help with food suplies, animals, and more.

So in my point of view and Luke's is to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If i were you i would definatly help thhose in need of foos suplies and animals. If you like/love animals and helping others in need this will be a perfect job for you.",3
0f50ec4,"I think it is very capable of being used in a classroom or elsewhere to use. In paragraph 3, it states that the technology scans 44 muscles in our face precisely, to determine how they have moved to show emotion. If a prinipal was talking to two students in his/her office who were in conflict, the prinicpal could hear both sides of the story, and then use that technology to scan the students' faces to see how they were feeling. If one felt 83% angry, and the other only felt 36% angry, he could talk to the kid that was more angry to try to get him to calm down. If he thought one of the kids was only pretending to be happy, he could scan their face as well and determine what emotions they were actually feeling.

In paragraph 7, the author explains how the technology can pin-point the facial muscle movement in order to precisely tell how the person is feeling. If a person was faking a smile, the scanner would detect that, because it says that when a person is not genuinely happy, their ""smile"" goes more sideways, and their cheeks don't move up. When a person is showing a real smile, their cheeks go up and their eyes squint, like crows feet.

So if a student and another student were in a principals office over a fight, instead of the principal asking them ""How are you guys feeling?"", he could just simply scan their faces' 44 muscles and let the software determine how they were feeling.

I like the idea of the facial scanning technology, but realistically, we probably won't have this in our schools anytime soon. It would cost too much and it isn't really a need. It is a helpful tool, but teachers and administrators don't need it when dealing with students.    ",4
0f51dbd,"Pursuting Venus

Imagine having a twin, but never knowing anything about your twin due to the dangers they posses. Well, Earth and Venus are a great example of that scenario. Earth being the planet us humans live on everyday of our lives, Venus´s aspects are similar to the ones of Earth´s. Keeping this in mind, Venus has a plentiful amount of dangers that lurk the planet, delaying the exploration of our twin planet. So why does the author suggest that we should pursue exploring Venus? The author belives we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetray vist, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself.

To begin, if Earth were to ever start to decade and there were still human life, would living on a different planet be an option? Astronomers have conducted studies showing that Venus may have once held life there itself. In paragraph 4, the article states; ¨Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rock sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This example shows that our Earth has similar factors of that which Venus has. Another example to show that us humans may one day be able to colonize Venus,if the occurence were to happen, is the conditions. In paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.¨ Although the statement claims that the conditions are not easy, they are still bareable to the human population. Summing up, Venus could soon be a home to us, and scientest will soon be able to know whether or not that is possible by exploring Venus.

Secondly, the exploration of Venus can provide more scientific facts, proving to be scientifically productive. To do this, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will send humans to collect data. Hostile conditions may play into how we do this, but NASA´s possible solution would allow scientists to exam our sister planet without interfearing with the hazardous conditions. In paragraph 5, the article states; ¨Imagien a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus wpuld avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way.¨ The idea of this hovercraft is based around the already scientfic facts of the planet Venus, such as the temperature and air pressure the hovercraft would be experincing. In paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.¨ Consenquently, the hovercraft could provide more benifical scientific evidence of planet Venus for our astronomers and scientists.

Last, but not least, using what we already know about the planet could help NASA and scientists to further explore Venus. Studies conducted to enhance our technology of exploration have shown what Venus could damage. In paragraph 7, the article states; ¨For example, some simlified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus´s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.¨ This exmaple shows what possible scenarios could produce from the pursuit of exploring Venus. The end results will then contribute to greater advancements of that certain technology to one day be able to withstand that conditions of Vneus. Overall, our previous knowledge combined with new facts and information can assist with how NASA and scientists will explore our sister planet.

Concluding, the author belives we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetray visit, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself. The conditions and atmosphere may affect how much we are able to learn and explore, but NASA has innovated new developments to help us explore further. Consuming all the information, data, facts, and end results have pushed the determination of exploration. With this all being said, are you ready to learn more about our sister planet Venus? ",4

0f549ce,"The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day. Technology that reads people's emotions would be beneficial in a classroom setting, because it would adjust lesson plans, make learning more fun, and could also help students struggling to focus in class.

The technology to read emotions would greatly change the way students learn. If a teacher used this technology and noticed that all of his students were bored and uninterested, he could alter the lesson plan to make it more fun. Not all students will feel the same, though, which is also where this technology could come in. At the beginning of a school year, perhaps, the teacher could use the technology on the class to see how they feel about the particular subject. Then, the students who are excited about the subject and show interest could be sorted into a class that can be run in a way that makes the class educationally suitable for students who actually want to learn that subject. The students that do not show as much interest, or none at all, could be sorted into a seperate class that makes the subject more fun, but still teaches the same points as the other class.

Another application of such technology in the classroom could help to make learning overall more fun for all students. If many students start to become bored, then the teacher could come up with a quick game to enrich the learning experience. If many of the students are already interested with the subject matter, the teacher may not have to do as much adjusting. If the students need to be enriched with games and activities, now the teacher will immeditely know. This could overall make learning a lot more fun, but introducing more games and activities into the curriculum as see fit. If the students want to play knowledge enriching games, they can just show disinterest, and the system would pick that up and inform the teacher. The technology to read student's emotions in the classroom as a very basic level could make learning more fun and personal to the student.

Reading students emotions would also be helpful to identify those students who are struggling to focus or simply understand the material being presented to them in class. If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously.

Adjusting lesson plans, making learning more fun, and helping struggling students are three of the main reasons in which emotion-reading teachnology would be amazing to introduce into the classroom. The students would control the class, not the teacher, and it would make the learning experience more customized to each particular class. As well, it would allow for more interesting games and activities to be introduced into the curriculum in order to keep learning entertaining and entriching. Students who struggle with particular subjects would be able to recieve help using the technology, and the teacher would not have to guess which students are struggling only based on grades. The technology of emotion-reading should be applied to all classrooms when it becomes widely available, because it could help both teachers and students improve the learning environment. ",5
0f560cf,"Venus is a very worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Why is it a very worthy persut depsite of the dangers? because Venus is the Safe vantage Point of Earth.Venus is the twin of Earth it is very close to the Earth and many other planets.Venus has a lot of

reasons to be

a worthy pursuit.

Venus has some dangers like not

a single spaceship has touched down or landed on Venus in three decades. It has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.The more challenging are the clouds of highly Corrosive sulfuric acid In Venus's Atmosphere. The temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and is 90 times greater than what we have to deal with on our own planet. These temperatures and conditions are far worse than what we humans have to deal with on earth. It could even crush a submarine. There are also frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Next is the benefits and upsides to Venus. Astronomers are shocked by Venus because it was one of the most

similar Earth Like planet in our solar System. Venus today still has some similiarities to Earth.Venus has

supported most forms of life and has covered largely with

oceans..

Venus can be our nearest option regardless of the distance in space travel.

Although, there are the upsides there stills questions on how to make going the travel and mission to venus both safe and scientifically productive.

The

National Aeroonautics and Space administation (NASA) has an idea by sending humans to study Venus. Nasa's possible soulution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Take a Vehicle for example it could hover of venus and avoid the friendly ground conditions

by staying up in the air and our the way. definitely are not easy conditions but humans are capable of surviving it.

Scientist are seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus and would to

find a way to get up close and personal regardless of the risks. Systems that use mechanical parts can be resistant and untouchable by pressure heat, and

other forces. Venus still being studied today by Nasa by finding different and safe approaches.

In conclusion the author idea on Venus being worthy pursuit depsite of the dangers is very true because Venus has value. The knowledge on Venus will clear up human curiousity and will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth should not be stopped or limited by dangers and doubts but should expanded by the imaginations.        ",3
0f5c12f,"One thing that robots have never been able to do is having emotions. The Facial Action Coding System can provide a new opportunity for emotions to be incorparated into technology. The software allows for computers to read emotions on human's faces and interpret that data. In a classroom, this software can be extremely valuable to educators.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom can prove to be an extremely powerful tool to educators, as long as it is used in moderation. An educator could use the tool during a lesson to make sure students are engaged, and if a student is bored, the teacher could adjust the lesson plan for that student. The teacher would also know when to help students if the machine is reading them as confused. However, the technology should not replace a teacher in the classroom, as Dr. Huang Suggest, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto). The software can read the emotions, but it can't provide it's own emotions or give the same one-on-one connection a teacher can to help a student. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should not be used as a teacher, but by a teacher, so as to help every student get the most out of their education.

While this new technology can be a fantastic tool, if not used properly, it could have a terriblle outcome. The machine can read a face and give percents of emotions someone is feeling, as shown in the first paragraph, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto). However, if humans start using this software constantly, it might begin to replace our own emotion reading skills. However, the ability of the software to detect certain muscle movements associated with faking a smile and other complex emotions, can prove extremely useful in a school. Educators can usually read emotions pretty well, but when a face shows mixed emotions and a student is trying to hide some of them, this system could help a teacher understand what's going through a student's head.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in computer and human interaction. Used carefully, this software can allow for teachers to be even more engaged in their students and know how each person is doing with a lesson. This technology is very valuable to the classroom and should be implemented to benefit student's education and to further our knowledge of emotions.      ",4

New cars nowdays are expensive, with driverless cars there would be no need for a personal car because the driverless cars would form a public-transportation system. Also, driverless cars would cut fuel requirements in half due to their precise steering and breaking systems. The self-driven cars would remove the flaws that people make in driving further reducing wear-and-tear costs. Driverless cars are a step in the direction of cost free transportation.

Driverless cars are not only cost effective, but they are also very safe. They showcase many safety options that optimize the safety of those in the car and those in other cars. They will be able to sense and react to disasters much better than people do. The information relayed from the sensors better adapts the car to make the best possible decision whereas if a human would go by the fight or flight instinct and possibly hurt themselves or others.

Driverless cars are not only safer and cheaper than modern day cars, but they offer more flexibilty than them aswell. The idea that a car does not need a driver will enable the person in the drivers seat to do other things such as reading or doing thier homework. BMW is working on an assisted driving program named ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" that will enable the driver to do other activities while the car is driving itself and when the time comes that the car cannot overcome the obstacle that it has encountered, it will notify the driver to take control of it. The car company Tesla is working on a vehicle that is planned to be released in the year 2016 that is capable of driving on its own ninety percent of the time. These improvements are groundbreaking and will better the future.

0f789a2,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right. ",6
0f79e39,"""Welcome"" says a screen once you get in the car. The driveless cars are coming and we have to get ready for them. Some people might not like the ideal but i here do. I would like to get in the car without putting my foot on the gas to get to my destination. I wouldn't have to worry if im going to fast or to slow. driveless cars are going to be the next big thing. They are going to attract lots of people. Driveless cars are going to help you get to you destination with out you worrying about being tired of driving, They can help you stay at one speed so you won' t worry about if your going to fast or to slow, and they are also are going to attract lots of people to them.

The driveless cars are going to help you to get to your destination without you simply being worry. They are going to help you so you won't be tired of driving to get to place and for you not to enjoy the place because of tireness from all that driving. They can get to destination faster than they can because of the GPS they have located them. They are a great help if you have children because the car can be moving and you won't have to worry about keeping your eyes on the road while your kids can be fighting in the back seat.

Driveless cars can also be a great help for they people who tend to go over limit. The car can stay at the limit you tell them to go or if you press the gas. It's an easy project for people to love. You can now go on trips and you won't have to worry about the police stopping you for going over the limit. you can also be on the highway and you won't have to worry about keeping your speed at a certain speed.

The dirveless car is going to attract many people when they come out. Many people from around the world are going to buy them. I know many people are going to say its a bad idea to have one because there are going to be situations when teenagers drive the car without a license. Other than that there is not a thing that anyone would like to have one. The driveless cars are going to be a worldwide sensational.

So like i was saying the driveless cars are going to be phenomenal when they are out. There are somethings the car wont be a good idea. For example the kids who are only 12 they are going to be around they city driving. other than that the car itself is a great idea. They are going to help you get your destination faster and you won't be tired. They are going to help you stay out of trouble from the police. They will help you stay at one speed rate and you wont have to worry about getting ticket while on vacation, They will also attract many people to get one. These cars are going to be a worldwide sensational when they come out. Many people will still have doubt on the car when it comes out but when them everywhere they are going to want one. So whats your opinon about driveless cars?",3
0f7aadf,"""Different things are converging which suggest that we witnessing a long term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller. As technology advances the world will start to get rid of things we use to use before, so that those new advancements could come and take their place, as time flies we might not need cars anymore, even though they are the most useful thing to get us from one place to another, they are also devastating for our community, and our environment. Now knowing that most people would never let go of there cars due to the amount of money people spend to buy them, that giving them up isn't going to be so easy. However giving up your car will have a major benefit to our everyday life, also there are many other alternatives that you could use instead of your car that will not only benefit you but also the people around you, such as bikes, busses, trains, and subways. Now that most companies are going green, they are developing ways to not let harmful gasses produced by vehicles that burn fossil fuels to stop damaging the earths atmosphere, so the air we breath isn't toxic and life threatening so maybe one day everyone can live in a much cleaner safer place.

In a suburb in Germany, the residents have given up their cars completely as to where street parking, driveways and home garages are a thing of the past. There are now only two known ways of parking which is having to buy a parking garage space for $40,000, and your house. It has been working very well because 70% of the towns families don't own cars, and 57% of the people sold their cars to move there. Now being in a car is where the true form of someone comes out, you don't need to even be a driver but you still will experience ""Road rage,"" thats when someone else gets so mad that they will start saying things they dont need, or want to say, but it just comes out with anger that they dont care about what they said. Being to angry is bad for someone because it causes stress and anger issues that will later lead on to heath problems and car accidents, now if we reduce the number of drivers, or even come to a point where driving a car doesn't even exist anymore, the amount of angry people will be reduced, thus making the world a little bit nicer than it already is.

Now bringing the topic back reducing cars will reduce the amount of accidents followed by them. Think about everyone you know, now picture those you love who have died by a car accident, Now whether they died by texting, drinking or someone else hit them    ",3
0f7c6f3,"I see driverless cars both dangerous and useful. They can help the dissabled and many people who can't drive at diffrent parts of the day.

People that would have driverless cars would be both lazy and easily angered at the car. The lazyness would come from the fact that they just have to sit in the car, and the anger would come when they had to put their hands on the wheel when the car wouldn't be able to drive its self.

The cars would need the human to direct it in the correct way at times it can't and the humans would be angry at the car when this happnes. Also the humans wouldn't see the point of having to take a driver's test. The humans would be angry at the licencing branch and the branch would go out of work because they don't have to test people.

Honestly, I think this would only be good for only a small amout of people, however if only a select few can use the cars the other people that can't would be angry. I think this could be harmful for the population, but this is only my idea others might find it helpful.",2
0f7cc68,"changing the election to popular vote would I think benefit us and this country. Whats the point on voting for the president if the electoral college is going to do it and will pick the final decision. the electoral college cinsits of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president, but what about us who vote. I feel like there is no point in voting if the whole election is based off the electoral college. This electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that runs in each state. candidates dont spend there time in the states they have no chance in winning in, they only spend there time in the states they think they can win in. For example in 2000 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all! Some people in these 17 states didnt see one ad at all. Its not like us voters can control who there electors vote for because some voters get confused about the electors and sometimes can vote for the wrong candidate. Its not fair to us if we dont matter in this vote at all, especially when the people running dont send an ad out to every state and dont visit every state. The election is held every four years and we help choose our states elecotors when you vote for president because when we vote for the cadidate we actually vote for the candidates electors so it doesnt really make an impact on votes and i think that we should vote for the cadidates themselves  not there electors. So i think changing the votes to popular vote would benefit us all even if we dont get an ad or see anythin in our state even if the cadidates think they dont have achance in winning they should still participate.

0f7dda8,"I think that we dont need to keep the Electoral College because it is not a good way for people to vote.

I think how we should vote is by a majority vote where whoever wins the popular vote from all states will win the election and become are president. So whoever gets the most votes per every state that is who will win. One reason why i dont think we need to keep the electoral college is because in the second sorce in paragragh 14 where it says ""It's official:The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It tells you that the electoral college makes it to where no matter who wins the popular vote the canidate will not win if the electoral college wants something different to happen.

""The Louisiaa legislature early succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" i wanted to bring this up because if the Electoral Colege did what they were trying to do then Kennedy never would have been the president and who knows what the history of that presidency would be today. The electoral college is good at some times but i think that who ever wins th popular vote should automatically be the president.

In the second sorce paragraph 2 it says ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" According to Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but did not win the presidency because of the electoral college.

Over 60 percent of the people that vote for the president would rather have a direct election than have the electoral college becuse the electoral college does what they want and they do not listen to the people.

I just think we need to no longer use the electoral college and just go by what the people of America think will be best for this country.    ",3
0f7e96b,"A new technologic advancement for reading emotional expressions of students would be a nice thing to have. Not all kids learn the same way as others do. When a kid is sitting in class and is struggling there might be something wrong but usually nobody asks to see if they can help.

Every kid has those days where they don't want to be at school and they are not in a very good mood. Teachers will be able to look at them ask whats wrong and then try to make the lesson a little different and easier to understand. When kids are better able to understand they will retain the information a lot easier and it will help them later on when they need to go back and remember what they have been taught.

Having computers that can recognize your facial expressions to help you learn would be a nice thing to have. In the world we live in today, there is technology everywhere you look and everywhere you go. In the school district I am in, every kid has their own MacBook and so we are always using technology for our school work. If the computers we used would be able to help us learn easier by telling our facial expressions then I feel like it would be a nice thing to have to help us learn and to succede in life.

Not just certain schools, but most schools around the world use electronics and computers. When you use the computer and get frustrated it would be nice if it could change the content of what you are doing to help you better understand what you are doing so you can learn it easier. With facial recognition with emotions would make it nice for the user and also make it a better learning tool for everyone to use.

Everyone has sat down at a computer and been frustrated on what they were doing but this could lower the frustration and make things easier for everyone. I do feel like this would be a nice thing to have in schools and that it would help kids and teachers out and that everyone would see a change in learning. ",4
0f81127,"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefinsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wronga' by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral College may disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is empahsized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're techniacally not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph six of ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voters want to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibilty of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Richard A. Posner states ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one. If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.               ",5
0f820c4,"Dear State Senator,

I believe that you should stick with the electoral college, because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it.

I also don't care to much for government. But if i did i would try to read the whole passage and give you a really good essay to read. But i don't and im not that sorry either and don't care. If your really want somones opinion you should ask someone who doesn't care ask one that does because then you would get a good answer but not from me.

Also next time you want to give me a passage don't give me one on the government. Because frankly no one im my grade will care because I certeny do not. But thats just my opinion. And i know that repeating things in an essay is bad but really, you need to give this passage to someone that care thats not me. And no one reallt cares about the fiasco in 2000 or any other year for that matter and you can't make them. Also if someone says that can't wright on a spicific topic belive them and try to change it please and thank you.

0f87684,"As of 1976, there has been ¨a photo from Viking 1¨ showing what appears to be face on Mars. This information came straight from NASA back when they first discovered the face. This is well related to the topic around aliens and alien theories. People have believed forever that aliens exist somewhere is the universe. Then recently becuase of the picture showing the face on Mars strengthening their beleifs. They have said, ""the Face is bonafide evidence of life on Mars.¨ Many people believe this face was a monument created by aliens so, here´s why they are wrong.

This photo was first taken sometime in 1976. It is a photo of small region of mars with a couple of formations. But one formation sticks out like a tall man in an elementary school. This picture was taken at the right angle at the right time. It makes it look a face with the angle and shadows. And many people believed it to be a monument made by extratellestular figures. Another reason why they believe for it to be made from aliens is because, ¨What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.¨

Their is a lot of people that would disagree with belief of this face being real. They would believe this way because they would it´s childish to believe that a rock formation on a foreign planet could ever possibly be made by aliens. Another reason why is because if it does resemble a earth-like formation that was not man made, that means the face was made by aliens, it was just an act of nature. It is physically challenging to make a formation, the shape of a human face, on a planet way far away from its neighboring planets.

People have also taken more recent pictures of the face. One in 1998 and another one in 2001. The newest one from 2001 is pretty old but gives the most recent information. It has the highest resolution of any picture of that face. In this picture, it is zoomed in more than the original photo and a lot more clear than the first one, their is a lot more detail. But in this photo, it doesn look like a human, it has more of a resemblance of a lion. But also, it looks to be more natural than before because the higher resolution and less blur.

Again, the people that have believed that the face wsa alien made rock formation were wrong. It is merely just a natural formation that has face-like features that was believed to be a face because of a shadow and a good camera angle. The so called ¨Face on Mars¨ is no longer real and was just a moment of glory for the people at NASA.",3
0f89327,"How do you feel about driverless cars? What do you think theyll be like for you in the future? Are they better than cars that have to be personally operated by the human? Well, they named a few good and a few bad things that would come with the driverless car. They told how you will still have to keep focus on the road in the driverless car because it will need to be hand driven when it comes to work roads and accidents that have happened or even traffic jams. THe good things they said about it would probably be, that it is sensored so you dont hit nothing or it tells you when something is wrong and where your far is at and how its driving itself.

The things that are good about the driverless car would be, it could drive itself, you could relax and chill while its taking you where you need to go. Also, its good because it has all these sensors in the car that it can tell when to brake, or when to slow down. This could be a good thing kind of , when it is driving itself you should always be prepared to take over. But it said in the article "" While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" So if they ever got into a car accident they could probably go back and look at the cameras too see what the driver was doing and how they crashed.

The things that are bad could be that whenever the car wants to go down the company could shut your engine off at any tme and at any place. Whether its still driverless or not you still have to pay attention so you might as well just stick with the divers car. the other bad thing could be your car can decide when to brake and that could be at any point and you could brake at the wrong time and someone could hit you. One bad thing that could also be good is the sensors , sometimes they could go out and your car could start messing up.

In my opinion i think driver cars are better because there is so much that could go wrong with the driverless car. Like the car going out and the sensors messing up and you just break down and you wouldnt know how else to fix it, because it has so much technology. But with driver cars you can know when there is a porblem, you know when and where you need to fix things under the hood or on the car in general. The driver cars are better i hink because the person in the car should always have their eyes on the road. If we have driverless cars what was the point in the drivers licence and permit if the cars will drive us? you know ?

With a drivers car where you have a person driving 24/7 you know how to operate the car. You know how to change the oil or how to change the breaks so they dont go out and you get in a wreck. I mean yeah you could do something wrong with the car and it mess up but im sure if you're working on a car you have done it before. But drivers cars you dont have to worry about the engine reducing power on you, you just fill the car with gas and your good. But driver ccars you gotta worry about the car breaking down etc.

But there are always to fix your broken down car unlike you can with driverless cars.

So if i had to choose any car whther it was drivers or dirverless, I think i would go with the drivers car. Because , for the fact i know i could trust the car and i could have the car checked to see if its good for running and driving unlike you could with the driverless car. The driverless car could be good for so long then something bad could happen and you not know what was wrong with it. So if i had to get a car of my choice between drivers and driverless i would most definitely choose drivers. ",3

If someone has an IEP the robot could tell the teacher that the student needs more help on this on subject. The robot could possible help the student understand it. If the student stil doesnt understand the problem or the subject, the robot could go and get him/her and say to them "" So and so needs your help on this problem or on this subject.""

0f8c08a,"Dear State Senator,

I, PROPER_NAME, think that we should not abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College has been used for many years and not been a problem til now. In my opinion, people are just getting upset because the nominees they voted for didn't get elected.

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachroninsm, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner"". (paragraph 15 in source 3) It's the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Some people don't know that. Though each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is rarely betrayed. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

In conclusion, many people are unaware of the election rules. They don't know what they are talking about when it comes to political stuff. Therefore, you should not listen and keep the electoral college!

0f8c21d,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus is most important to the Earth that is close to the planet where people in. Sometime the challenge of the planet is for humans to study, apprently it's proximity to us. The author support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers becuase sometime Venus is right around the corner and human will sent some spacecraft to land. Not only studying Venus will pursuit other life, but some scientist are looking forward to work with the Venus to undertanst more of the challenge that they will know more about.

The first reason why venus will pursuit despite the danger it present is that venus are also a planet becuase the reader know that it's the second planet that from our sun. It could be a bad idea that '' Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface "". This is way studying are needed to be used with protection at any case that involved danger.

The second most reason important about the challenge of Venus in this planet as an enviornment would crush can be made as "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth "". Because of this solar system like Venus impact the hottes surface temperature of the planet. The challenging of Venus consider many researchers into working with the machines that probably would allow them to constribute it's to be knows as knowledge.

Most third reason that will be know is that scientics are more knowable to learn more about Venus than other people because they are more to understand better. More likely, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation "" just as we know about how it should not be limited, most people woun't know what to do unless they know what will be next in their challenge. It somehow need to be survivable for humans as well into going forward on something that is challenge.

In conclusion, the challenge of Venus is really important to most of the people because venus is like the second planet that need to be look out for and this the reason it dangerous to explore. All it take was to have a scientics that are impresive to know where it actually is. ",4
0f8d16d,"Is Venus survivable? Venus is the only planet in our solar system that's like Earth. The author stated three reasons why its worth exploring. The first reason it's like Earth, the second reason is scientist can make discovery, and last but no least it's going to be challenging.

Venus is as closest as Earth, some of the feature they have are density and size, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" (paragraph 4) If Earth was dying Venus would be the first place we would go to. scientists said that the only reason why we cant go there now is because of the temperatures.

If scientist can discover Venus there there may be a chance we can discover other planet as well and if we know everything about Venus we can sent people there. NASA is finding ways to to explore Venus like ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""(parapraph 7) This shows that sooner or later scientist will find a way to make Venus survivable.

The challenging parts are the floor of Venus is way too hot, the text states that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" the longest they can land there three weeks without getting burn. That's the main thing that's keeping humans from Venus.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth it has it's differences and similarties. Venus is the referred at ""twin"" to Earth. Scientist/NASA are working on a way to make Venus survivable. ",4

their face. The use of this technology to read emotion is valuable for many reason.The reason are that it will make us understand how our friends are feeling, to make sure the politician or celebrity is being truthful, and it help us with our

everyday life.

The first reason is that the Facial Action Coding Stystem will help us understand how our friends feel. According to paragraph 5, and line 2, it stated that "" you can probable tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" There always that friend that doesn't express herself well. If she need help with her life or when she is sad she won't understand how to express these emotion to her friends. This will help the people to understand how they feel and know when they need a shoulder to lean on.

Futhermore, the technology will help the citizen identify whether the politician or the president is being truthful. Paragraph 8, line 4-6, it explain, "" these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful."" If we don't have this type of way to figure out if our politician are worth it, then the world would be a mess. We would never know if that person is very truthful in his or her job. Also it a good way to find that good president that will guide us with real emotion and not a fake one.

The last reason is that the tecnology will help us with our everyday life. According to

the last paragraph, it stated that "" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.(""Putting on a

happy face"" actually work!)"" When we have work or when

go out it always important to have a happy face. When you look mad and depressed, other people around you will know and they will judge you. Having a happy face will make the other think highly of you. You will be able to get along with your co-worker very well. It to make your life easier and better.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System is valuabe because it allow you to understand your peers emotion, when a politician is being truthful, and help you make many friend. Some may argue that it personal and it not our buisness to know how a person feel. In order to make our world better, everyone should understand each other emotion for it to be easier to communicate. Other will understand and make this world peaceful.",4
0f93a88,"The Author supports the idea of studying Venus very well. They give informational texts such as statistics and important information that intrigues the reader into wanting to know more about our ""sister planet"". He explains his idea,of studying Venus, our ""sister planet"" , by using facts such as Venus being the closest planet to us, describing the atmosphere the planet has on a daily basis, and incluiding the fact that even astronomers are fascinated by it.

When the author said "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth. Despite Earth and Venus being our neighboring planet there's still many accomdations they must keep in mind,yes they have similar mountains and other landmade items, but it's also very different. In paragraph, 3 the author tells us how about 70 percent of the planets atmosphere is consitsed of carbon dioxixde. This would surely put the life of a human in danger. With all of this information and comparing and contrasting being made the author is still able to provide us with accurate infromation about the planet itself.

""Even astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" the author says in paragraph 3. Breaking it into a segment of fascination for the astronmers because it has so many earth like similarities such as, a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. The fact that land made surfaces, that are prominently known on Earth,are being found on Venus shocks the readers and provides them with an inspiration to see more similaritites. They go as far as to mention that Venus may have once been scattered with oceans. This surpised me very much considering the fact that a planet a years travel away would have some of the same natural things happening on them.

When discussing the possibility of traveling to the planet one day, the author describes the climate as being very hot. Observing the planet from a ship orbiting or hovering far above the planet provides only limited sight on the ground conditions because some light simply cannot break past the dense atmosphere. Due to the almost opaque climate NASA has been working on different approaches in order to study the climate.

The author does a fantastic job of supporting his claim of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They included some of the most important ordeals and questions some may have regarding to the situtation. They address the climate, astronomers fascination with the planet,and discussing the relativeness it has to Earth. The author provides a strong claim at the end that somewhat encourages the reader, by saying "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and inovation"" he is saying that our advances in the future should not be limited, but adjusted to meet the requirements needed to expand our knowledge.

In other words Venus is the most close to Earth. Another immportant poin is that is not only Venus that it's close to our planet it's ""Mars too"". According to the author,"" These differences in sped mean that sometimes were closer to Mars and other to

Futhermore, the temperature of Venus is one os the most hottest temperature. According to the author ""Venus has the hottes surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even thought Mercury is closer to our sun"". In other words Venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system, and Venus is not the close to our sun. To clonclude Venus shlould be study and see if in the future it can create live.   ",1

0fb0f34,"This story is talking about venus in the challenge trying to exploring it its like its hard trying to exploring it because it got all these things wrong with it like its close to the sun in everybody know if you get to close to the sun your going to die but its really talking about how making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot venus however this nikname is misleading since venus is actually a planent if you didnt know. in our solar system venus is the second planet from our sun. while venus is simple to see from the distant but sfe vantage point of earth is has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. often referred to as earth's ""twin"", venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth,Venus,and Mars, our other planetary neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds. these differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to Venus. because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a fwe hours. Maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship ha touched down on venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study despite its proxinity to us. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. ven more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenhit and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. ",2
0fb1945,"The author of 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" definietly leans towards giving it all we got and pushing to find a way to land on Venus. In paragraph 3, the author describes the different dangers of even being on Venus, like the atmosphere being to thick and made out of carbon dioxide, and the tempatures being extremely high. Even so, the author writes about how it's the cloesest thing to earth beside Mars, and even says it could have been covered by large oceans and mountains and could even support LIFE on it at some point or another.

paragraph 3 and 4 both talk about both of these points, along with paragraph 5, which includes NASA scheming up ideas for how avoid Venus's dangerous conditions. Such ideas include a blimp like vehicle 30 or so feet above the ground. Although it'd give much better insight than staying on the very edge of the planet's atmosphere, such an idea wouldn't be able to recover samples of any kind since i'd be too high up.

The author gives off even more ideas that NASA is thinking up, which lets the reader know that he's very headstrong about this situation and generally loves the idea of exploering Earth's neighbour. The author ends his passage by telling the reader that dangers and set backs shouldn't hold us back from exploring not just Venus, but everything else in life. while there'll be way more set backs and problems, the author is confident that the human race can achieve everything and ""expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

All in all, the author supports his claim greatly. He goes over why Venus should even be explored, his and NASA's ideas for exploering said planet, and the challenges it presents along the way. By the end of the story, the reader can tell that the author is very passionate about exploering this foreign planet that we all know of as Earth's relative, and he's very excited about what will come about these challenges and ideas NASA has came up with. We shouldn't be limited or set back by doubts and set backs, the author's right about that. We should reach for the stars and go in as headstrong about anything we face, just as the author did.",3
0fbd5ba,"Many look up into the sky and see Venus, one of the brightest points in the night sky. While it looks like a star, it is actually a planet. In fact, it is a planet that is extremely difficult to examine closely. According to the author, it is transparent that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers due to the fact that Venus used to be very similar to Earth, the conditions are survivable, and that there are many approaches that can be taken to explore it. The author supports the idea that exploring Venus has immense value well.

Foremost, Venus used to be very similar to Earth. Scientists can research Venus and discover its differences and similarities to Earth. Paragraph four of the article states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This demonstrates that astronomers are curious about Venus's transformation from a once Earth-like planet to an inhospitable planet. Paragraph four also states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This is crucial because space travel can often take long periods of time. The travel time to Venus will not take nearly as long as other space endeavors.

In addition, Venus's conditions can be survivable to humans. If the expeditions are controlled and cautious, endeavors to Venus are definitely possible. In the article, paragraph five says,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would alllow scientists to float above the fray."" NASA's plan for trips to Venus would be similar to having a spacecraft hovering over Venus's atmosphere. Paragraph five also proclaims, ""air pressure would be close to that of sea level at Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that the journey and process will not be extremely hazardous. The conditions at thirty miles above Venus's atmosphere would be simlar to the condtions on Earth. The dangers are not present at this altitiude and astronomers are still able to collect useful data.

Moreover, there are many other innovative approaches to studying Venus. Paragraph seven states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions."" This displays how researchers can explore Venus's surface without risking human lives. This method is safe and nonhazardous toward humans and is necessary to advance the research of Venus. Paragraph six declares, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough missionto understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are building machines to decrease levels of risk and contribute insightful knowledge to the cause, which makes exploration seem all the more desirable.

Overall, expeditions to Venus are valuable. Gaining statistics about Venus will not only be helpful for scientists analyzing Earth but also with future space missions. Venus is close and similar to Earth. Exploration is survivable and can be safe with the right technology. The author presents these ideas thoroughly and accurately to inform that space travel to Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus, one of the brightest ""stars"" in the sky, will lead travels from Earth beyond doubts and towards innovation.",5
0fc7b60,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" with the facial action coding system, is a way of a computer being able to read a humans emotions, isnt it kind of weird? technology is progressing more and more everyday, but this isnt something we need, why do we need to read peoples emotions? is it important?

This program allows other people to invade the privacy of others, i would want someone or something reading my emotions just because, even if who ever is trying to ""read"" your emotions asked for permission its still called personal space, this program to me is kind of useless, maybe there are some ways it could be useful?

In some cases it can be used for people in the hospital, you know when you go get checked up the doctor normally asks you how you feel, and sometimes you dont know how you feel but the doctor needs to know in order to treat you.

But in some other cases, it should not be used in schools or in working areas, dont you think that the students will kind of be scared of that? theres no use for it, maybe some people will make use out of it but some people dont want you ""reading"" their emotions at all, and you have to respect that.

0fc8125,"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

0fcadb2,"There could be reasons of how you can join the program. There is a lot of reasons. Luke had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Luke signed up to join the program, which is, UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrations). The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" because they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and his friend signed up and they went to New Orleans. They found horses there. They keep on going to places, that was like an adventure to them. They keep on going and they were arriving to Greece for their second mission.

Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

0fe6787,"Have yo ever wondered what it would be like without a car in America or anywhere else? well im going to give you a little on how it feels not to have a car.

First, Vauban Germany- Residents which they are an upscale community which they are suburban pioneers with just a few soccer moms or commuting executives. French and Swiss borders streets are "" car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where Freiburg runs. Owners must get a larger garage or the must park on a large edge which can lead up form $40,000 just right along with a home. As the results came in 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own a car and most of them like 57 percent sold their cars in order to move where they was from to be down in Vauban's. As Heidrun Walter say "" I'm much happier this way"" she is just a mother of two and she walks right along verdant streets where the swish of the biycles and the children and adults chattering instead of hearing a loud motor coming up and down the streets where her and two children walk on.

Next, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. They enforced this law on a Monday for even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a big fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates on that following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and according to the Reuters about twenty-seven people had their car impunded due to they got into a phyiscal altercation with the police officers when they was handing them their tickets or they wouldnt comply to the rules that they had made so that they could clear the air. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to about 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to the Reuters. The smog cleared enought Monday for the ruling French party to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on a tuesday with the complaintes from delivery companies for the lost of revenue, while they didnt expect to have a hyrbid cars with only carrying three or more passaengers at that time.

Finally, Bogota, Colombia a capital city where during most days they hiked, biked, skated or even took buses to work during a car-free day like yesterday, leaving their cars on the streets nearly devoided a traffic jam on the side of that street. Just being it's third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Days Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogotoa. "" The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Carlos Arturo Plaze and his wife have rode a two-seat bicycle so that they can help stop the smog. In the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily which lead to that most of Americans either dont have jobs in order to pay to get a new car or that people with jobs either brought cheaper cars which held aleast amount of gas. There was a drop in the percentage of 16-to-39-year-olds getting their license, while most of the older genertation just retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found.

In Conclusion, Having cars in certain places is a dangerment not only to that city or state but to their people and the air pollution which can lead to way more dangerous things.            ",2
0feef16,"Limited car usage has plenty of advantages. A few examples of advantages that come from limited car usage are lessining the amount of gases polluting the air, also it would create a friendly and neighborly enviorment, and a large amount of money would be saved.

To limit car usage has huge benefits; we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremly affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passneger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" (rosenthal). That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would intteract. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburben areas would generally become just a friendly enviorment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""(selsky). That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they want/need. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""(Rosenthal). Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.                                 ",5

You can bike ride on trails and paths to explore your city or suburb, just look at Columbia. They've also made changes to having no cars in their lives. They participate in their own car-free day. This day has now seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin America city. Being car-free for Columbia also means rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Furthermore, limitations on cars should be reduced because of the amount of greenhouse gases they cause which depletes our ozone layer and pollutes our air that we breath. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of emissions of greenhouse gases in Europe, and about 50 percent is areas that cars are frequently used in the United States. But its not just the US, even in France car emissions are polluting the air. Paris, had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in brussels and 79.7 in London.

Like it was said im the text, it could adjust an assignment for a student to make it more engaging for them. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'Alto). That would make teachers lifes easier, and have less annoyed and out of control students, because they would be doing an assignment they would want to do, and not be extremely bored throughout class. Another way this could be valuable is for when cops do lie detector test. They would be able to pick up movements in the face that could show them that they are lying, or not telling the whole story. There are also many real world applications for this technology out there.

The FACS made by Prof. Thomas Huang could have many real world applications that would make life easier or more fun for some people. One of the many real world applications for this system would be Police Videos. You would be able to see the emotions on the criminal's face while he was being recorded on video, helping the police aid in the investigation. Another brought up by the article could be politics. You would be able to see how the politician is feeling, or which emotions. You would also be able to tell if they are faking emotions they are emitting while they are giving a speech, or if they are outright lying to you. The article itself says ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" (D'Alto). The final point I want to bring up is how this could be used for therapy or working through yout problems.

The FACS system could be a great peice of technolgy for therapists to use, working posple through their issues. People could tell how angry or depressed you were actually feeling. It would be a good way to work through the problems you have been facing, because people would know how you are feeling. The machine is able to sense the emotions you have been feeling, so people would be there to comfort you and work through your emotional turmoil. It would make venting about your problems much easier, and less hard to agknowledge

The FACS system is an important and valuable peice of technology for people to use that will most likely become valuable in the near future. It has countless applications, from Police work to Emotional Therapy. In conclusion, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nibu Sebe has most likely make an invalubale innovation in the scientific feild with many real world and scientific innovations.",5
1032c21,"You and your friends and family could often have arguments on whether something is real or not, such as in movies. Some might think one thing is special effects, others will think it is real. In Unmasking the Face on Mars, the author explains controversy of the ""face"" found on Mars' surface. It became an icon once it was released to the public. It was highlighted for decades and the society argued over it being an alien making, or just a land form called a mesa. The face was just a natural landform and it shouldn't have been thought as an alien form.

The most logical answer to this was that it was a mesa, and that the shadows on the surface happened to make it look like a human face of an egyptian pharaoh. This struck civilization in the late 70s and caused a lot of arguments. The people that thought is actually was an alien structure were just people of the press who just wanted attention. A Mars Global Surveyor "" snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared an a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quotes directly states and gives evidence that it is just a natural landform.

There isn't even any true or logical evidence that the face on Mars was an "" alien artifact."" It was just a rumor that went around to keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies. The cameras even took a picture with a ten times better resolution than the 1976 picture of the face. In addition, the new picture even had each pixel in the image span 1.56 meters in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel. Garvin talks that "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" and that "" if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Garvin directly states here that no matter what, the formation couldn't have possibly been an alien formation or even a pyramid. This is even more proof that it is ridiculous to think that the formation was an "" alien making .""

Although the face was thought to be alien, there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't. Scientists would wish that it was an extra terrestrial sign, but the odds of that are too scarce to even consider. This was a very controversial topic, as I have stated before. All of the theorists out there had many different and unique opinions of it. The narrator says what the image "" actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landfroms common around the American West. "" It remeinds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin."" This evidence gives even further support that it isn't extra terrestrial, and states that it isn't, shich exposes that it is a fluke.

The face on Mars was an ongoing argument for years to come once it was released to the public. There was no reason to do so. There was already valid points that gave proof of it being just a mesa. Things like this occurence happen all the time, even in your daily life. If things like this run across your mind, think about it the logical way and not a very, very unlikely path about it. There may be similarities between the sides, like in this argument. But, there was too much to show that it favored the more realistic side of it. The passage has multiple occurences where it directly states just that.",5
1035807,"My position on driverless cars is that we shouldnt have them. The excess money that their spending to make these car we could be spending on something more important. Driverless cars will be expenssive so many people coulnt afford them.

We shoulnt have driverless cars because at any moment they could maulfunction and could wreck. Since their driverless who would be at blame when you wrecked the computer or the person in the car? We would have to put so much money into changing the roads so the cars would work. Road work would have to be minumised so that we wouldnt have to touch the wheel at any point.

My final statement is that no we shoulnt make them because of all the money that will be wasted on making them and roadwork. We would be saving money and they wouldnt be losing money because only people that are rich could afford a car like this and people that cant would just be left out of the whole thing.",2

Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditios by staying up and out of their way.

At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees, but the iar pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable.

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life.

Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.

103c22b,"Dear State Senator,

I think that we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. One main reason why i think we shouldnt keep the Electoral College is because the congress men that vote are in replace of us as citizens and our votes. The Electoral College is what we might call the diaster factor. It is unfair to many citizens because democratic electors can easily oppose their vote and vote for a different president. For example, new electors opposed for John F. Kennedy but in reality the vote didnt go to him. Another issue with Electoral College is that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If we change the system to electing by popular vote everybody will have the right to vote for whom they desire too without having to worry about that their vote may change.

Dearly,

A citizen.    ",2
10416ad,"Nonverbal communication is often used more than verbal. The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another gadget, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may clome along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the cirriculum because they do not understand the way it is being taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because the aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teaher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a nutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is being taught, the teacher could re-word the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored of the material then the teacher may need to make some assgnment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students get exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could suggest way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be avalible in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article give instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environment when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in class rooms may improve the teavhing style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.

10642eb,"I know this wasn't created by aliens in many ways. It is just a naturally created landform that looks like face. If it was created by aliens then NASA would benefit from discovering life on a different planet, so that shows that everyone in NASA is sad that we didn't find life. Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.

Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.

These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real. This concludes that the Face was only created by weather like the landforms on Earth.",2
1064c41,"By reading this article I would be in no doubt certain that using FACS (Facial Action Coding Systme) for the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It could keep the attention of the students inside a classroom.

In paragraph 6 it mentions why FACS is a good and helpful tool to use inside a classroom. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Adanced Science at the Unversity of Illinois, ¨A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,¨ Dr. Haung also goes on and predicts ¨Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.¨ By Dr. Haung telling us this information it shows us that by using FACS our students may pay better attention in class becuase they are not confused nor bored. Another reason why using FACS is important is because it has the potential in increase the students intelligence.

In conclusion, FACS is a good and helpful advancement in techology that could one day be in schools everywhere. It would make school less boring and could keep the attention of the students inside the classroom. ",2
106d4c6,"In this artical the author suggests that studing venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea by providing some information about Venus and how similer and different it is compared to Earth. In paragraph one, the author states how Venus is the second planet from our sun. Then in paragraph two, the author tells us that Venus is often referred to as Earths twin."" The author also states how Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density, size, and distance. Since Venus is right around the corner, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.

In paragraph two, it states that each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours. The author then stated, that maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has landed on Venus for more than three decades.

1085852,"The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed. This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote.

There is a disaster factor.  According to ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people. Some people may argue that the states know what they are doing and are cautious on who to pick, but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting.

When you vote, there is a slight possibility of a tie occuring. If this were to happen, the state delegations would vote on which president. Each state will cast one vote, which is not fair because of the amount of representives in different states. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" is stated in source 2. Some people may say that the bigger states are helpful with voting because the Electoral College will balance out what the large states loss by the population votes. This still isn't fair because this is saying that the smaller states with less representatives do not have much say in the voting and this will turn off potential voters.

Some presidents may have a stronger appeal to some states then others. It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power. ""...such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,"" is stated in source 3. This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states. This is like the winner takes it all, they may know that they have no chance in winning. (Obama did end up winning and was titled as the 44th President of the United States. To others, they may say that each persons vote does count but it doesn't seem like it. The voters in the South didn't see any campaign ad by Romney which was not fair because he was not concerned about them not voting for him.

The Electoral College is not a fair process. It worked in the past, but not anymore. Using the popular vote process is more fair for all of the people. They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events. We need to encourage potential voters because one day, when they become older, they will be the voters of our country.    ",5
10b6508,"Imagine a day where there will be no driver at the steering wheel of a car, problems would eventually arise, specially if there are accidents and people don't know who to blame. Driverless cars that exist today are not entirely driverless, they someone who can take comand if there are traffic problems or construction ahead. Everyday technology advances more and more, some companies believe that in the future there will be cars that opeate by themselves without the need of having someone there incase of a problem, some companies even have a prediction for when such cars will come out into the market. Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road.

First of all, Driverless cars shouldn't be be on the road because they will not be able to operate correctly if there is a problem in the raod. Driverless cars today still need someone there incase there are problems in the road that only humans can take care of, how will a car know what to do in this type of situation, they don't think like people. There are situations that could happen while a driverles car is on the road that sometimes can not be foreseen, therefore the car cannot be programed for such situation. Humans normally know what to do if there are roads constructions ahead or there is something on thee road, like a ditch to avoid, and in these situations how can a car 'see' what goes on in the road. Even if the cars were to have sensors for the outside, what about the inside, if there was a problem with the passanger the car wouldn't be able to tell what to do.

Additionally, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road because how would law apply to them. There are many accidents that happen in the road every day, law is applied in this situations to know who is to take the blame and what to do.

In the situation of a driverless car it would be dificult to pinpoint how law would apply to them, if an accident were to happen, would the manufacturer or the driver be the one to take the balme. There isn't even a driver in this car, and sometimes technology malfunctions occur, so no one could really take the blame. With time anything can malfunction, but if an accident that involves death is to occur how would the problem be managed if there is only a car, technology, to blame and take resposibility.

Most importantly, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road beacuse there will be too many expenses. If there would be driverless cars in the future, how much would you be charged for being taken somewhere by such a car. In today's world there is almost always a cost in order to get any type of service, the drverless car would, most likely, have a cost in order to be used, and at first that wouldn't be cheap. A driverless car would steal chaufers jobs, and sometimes those jobs are all that sustain some people, so this car would make many not have a way to get paid. At first when this cars are being constructed, how will they be paid for, each city would probably have to spend a vast amount of money to get this cars so they can start operating.

In conclusion, Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road. If these cars were on the road there will be too many expenses, how would law apply to them, and they won't be able to operate correctly if there is a problem on the road. There will be many problems with these cars, and conflicts will be harder to slove with them. If they are released into the market, a person should first think of all the things and conflicts that may arise just because of one car before using it.",5
111b844,"More companies are pouring in more and more money trying to make the perfect driveless cars but pursuing the driveless car is a negative thing for car manufacturing should not be pursued. Developing driveless cars could make driving easier but is a neagtive thing becuase there is a big safety concern, it can make driving boring, and it still requires the assitance of the driver.

Driveless cars have huge and complicated safety risk. Driveless cars are not perfectly save and can cause major problems when driving in places with construction or complicated traffics or complicated driving routes and if the driver does not take control of the car, the driver and the passengers in the cars and other people can get seriously injured. Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems. Driveless cars are dangerous and can be hazardous to the driver and the people around the driver and also leave you to deal with the consequences of an accident.

Driveless may seem cool at first, being able to drive all by thereself and not needing the help of any real person but what does that do to the driver. With driveless cars it makes driving cars for the driver boring. Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk.

Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true. These so called driveless cars are not driveless car but are cars that can do basic functions of driving but when anything hard pops up, the driver has to drive the driveless car. This is a real problem becasue having a driveless car should mean that the car should be able to drive without the help of the driver but they can not and make the driver just sit there in the driver seat, staring out the window waiting and getting bored, so they can drive the driveless car when it is in a hard driving condition and if they do not do that they are in risk of a harazardous accident. One of the most technonlgical advances car made by BMW, is a driveless car and is suppose to be driveless car but is it really, the car can only handles speeds up to 25 miles per hour and any faster and the driver has to take over and even when the car is driving itself the driver needs to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel. These self proclaimed driveless cars may look like driveless car but they are not, they require as much assiatant from a real person as non-driveless cars do.

Companies all over the world are spending money to make the best driveless car out there but is it really worth it. Driveless cars are not a positive aspect to the automotive industry but is a negative aspect of the industry. These so called driveless cars need the assistance of real life human drivers as much or even sometimes more then regular non-driveless cars, these driveless car also are extremely boring to drive and ride for the driver adn companies can't find a way to fix it, and last but not least these driveless cars are hazardous. These cars can cause accidents, can not deal with hard driving, and can leave you with the consequnces of a horrible accident. Driveless cars might sound amazing and awesome part of the future but it is an negative aspect of the automotive industry and letting that negative aspect get s foothold in the future will be disatorous.

112723e,"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years.  More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline.  In Robert Duffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with.  In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars.  The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage.  In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""(Duffer 16) This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel.  Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket.  Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment.  In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.S(Rosenthal 5).  This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars.  By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs.  A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.(Rosenthal 37)""  A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that.  The encouragement of governments to suggest car-pooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls.  If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road.  Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.(Rosenthal 40)  Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once.  With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year.  Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.(Selsky 20)By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars.  With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road.  Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored.  Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.(Rosenthal 35) Because of this,  people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family.  This has created a domino effect; people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society.  They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues.  By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.            ",5

With driverless cars we are one step closer to a much safer, and easier driving experience. In the not to distant future we wont have to make dad stay awake the whole drive to Disney world just to make it there on time. We no longer will have to hop in our vehicles when we are moving and have to go back and forth and back and forth from our old home to the new. Instead all that will be required of us is to pack the car full of items and ship out the car and have someone ready to unload it.

And watch out BP! With the new driverless cars we will being making half as many stops for gas than we have ever had to before! Last, but most definatly not least important is your safety. In the new smart driverless cars accedents are surely to drop a hefty percent. Keep your eyes on the horrizon, or close them and take a nap while the the car takes the wheel.

Everyone can relate to those long hauls to out of state, whether it be for vacation, visiting relatives, or work. The most memorable part, for myself at least, was wondering where we were going to stop and sleep, or if dad was going to just keep on driving. That will be something of the past in the not so distant future. As of now the cars we have can drive on there own.. Most of the time. There are still some trouble spots such as traffic jams, work zones, and accidents. In the previously stated mishaps the current versions of the cars will promptly alert the driver that there may be an upcoming event in which they will have to intervene.

Gas in the surrounding area currently is sitting around $2.75. From what I know the average car can hold somewhere around 30 gallons of gas. Lets say you fill up your tank and ride until its empty and then fill it up again, and lets also say that it takes you about a week to empty your tank. So on monday you fill it up for around $82.50. Come next weeks monday you need to fill up for another $82.50. In a span of two weeks you have spent $165.00. There are about 4 weeks in a month so that will be $330.00 a month. But you dont just drive your car for a month, so for a year you will be paying roughly $3960 a year! In the new driverless cars they can take that almost $4000 and cut it down to around $2000 since with the technology in the new cars you will be stopping in at a gas station about half as many times as you would be if you were driving in one of the old cars.

The complany Google has sent out a fleet of driverless cars already (with drivers in them ready to take the wheel at any given moment.) to help further the progress towards these great machines. They have driven around half a million miles (500,000 miles!) and are yet to crash. Google´s Toyota Prius is modified with position-estimating sensores on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. With this massive combonation of the latest technology we can say goodbye to blindspots for good!

Safety, luxery, money. All three of those are what the new smart driverless cars are offereing. It is almost our duty to open our arms to the advance of this technology. With Google at the helm of the team that will bring us the cars we need and deserve, they will be in the news quite soon.",5
120cb91,"I believe that the negative aspects of driverless cars outweigh the positive ones. There are too many complications and problems that are yet to be solved. Driverless cars are a very unique and interesting invention, but I am not in favor of the development of these cars. There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly.

Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.

I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars.

Lastly, driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. With this, you would need to figure out an effective way to alert your driver when their assistance is needed. If the driver could not be alerted, then this could lead to massive consequences. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote highlights the neccesity of getting the driver's attention. If in any case the driver was not able to be alerted, the repercussions would be severe.

In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. ",5
12309f9,"Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of ""The Challenge Exploring Venus,"" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to ""intimidating endeavors."" The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well by using previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics that catch the readers attention.

The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand. He mentions, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.

The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus. The article mentions that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus."" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.

Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.             ",5
12a1427,"That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the ""face""that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).

It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.

If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around?Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.

Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.

Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.

There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a ""werid"" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool. I guess we will have to keep looking on other planents to find live or ""aliens"" because so far it is for sure not on mars!",5
131a75b,"Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.

Schools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. ""For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different."" What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.

The article states, "" ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor."" "" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."". A student will most likely do better just having a teacher because of the facial expressions or body language a teacher gives while teaching can help them better retain the information given rather than a screen teaching it to them, and if a teacher is doing a lecture in front of a class there is no need for a student to have out a laptop computer or an ipad unless it is called for that class and the teacher would be able to answer questions, not the computer.

The Facial Action Coding System software should not be used in the classroom. It is not of value to a student's education, it would be a waste of money and time to install it onto student ipads or computers. It is a complete invasion of privacy to today's youth to be constantly looked at through a little camera just to see if they are confused or not when they could just simply raise their hand and ask a teacher. Though it has many benefits, it has more pros than cons. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is supposed to convince the audience reading it that Facial Action Coding System software should be put in schools, reading it would make one feel the opposite.

13f75ec,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this proccess in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with thier own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This proccess would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidencey,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winner-takes-all system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

United States Citizen.    ",5
14706c7,"Highways, roads, streets; they are everywhere. No matter where you are or what part of town, these are always found nearby. Wherever roads are found, so are cars. People have been driving vehicles since the 1950's and over time, have had many positive effects on the world; but they have also had many negative effects. Luckily, the government has been helping to reduce car usage to save the world. Limiting car usage helps the world become a better place by decreasing pollution and keeping individuals active.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars make up ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"" and can be responsible for ""50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). These percentages show how much humans rely on cars, which is negatively impacting countries. Greenhouse gases are extremely awful for the environment, and if they are not decreased significantly, then the Earth could become a bad place for existance. In many places, government officials have been trying to limit the percentage coming from cars, which has helped greatly. Rosenthal claimed in a different article, The End of Car Culture, that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was...equal to where the country was in January 1995."" The drop of this percentage has decreased the amount of greenhouse gases in the world. Many events all over the world have contributed to the lower percentage. For example, the Car-Free Day in Bogota, Columbia has been a huge hit since the mid 1990's and is continuing to grow each year (Andrew Selsky, Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). This activity along with others will continue to bring the percentage down until it is hopefully extremely small.

Fast food and the lack of exercise has increased the number of obese people greatly. With a lack of transportation, there is a bigger opportunity for individuals to eat healthier and exercise more. Andrew Selsky, a writer from the Seattle Times published an article about Bogota's Car-Free Day. He confirmed that ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths,"" (Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). The building of new sidewalks has increased the number of people using them each day. With more people walking and exercising, the rate of obesity should decrease dramatically. Not only is exercising important, but eating healthy is as well. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities in Germany are now stating, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). Since there can only be a limited number of shops in the city because they have to be close by, healthier options have been chosen more often, keeping people in shape. Not only do the individuals look healthier, but they feel better.

Saving the Earth and other people are two huge causes for limiting car usage. Keeping both alive and healthy can keep everyone happy and safe. Reducing car usage has great advantages and all humans should consider different methods of transportation; walking, bking, or even carpooling are great alternatives to help the world. It may not seem like it now, but the decision of limiting car usage can be a life or death situation.    ",5
14a1792,"Many people believe that there should be technology in a classroom, but do we really need technology that reads emotions. The Facial Action Coding System is the system that was designed by scientists to read emotions. They believe that teachers could use this system for lessons online. Even though it could help teachers, it shouldn't be used in a class. This technology could have many flaws that would produce false readings. Especially when reading kids emotions. This technology does help in many ways, but there are some things that humans have to do by them selves.

Teachers need to stop relying on technology to teach. A teacher should be required to take classes that can help them become a better teacher and to help them with reading emotions. Instead of them using the Facial Action Coding System to find out kids emotions they should take a psychology class. That class will teach them what they need to know about humans. Especially humans going through adolesence. Once those teachers understand how emotions work they wont have to rely on a technology that isn't flawless.

The Facial Action Coding System has so many flaws in it that prevent it from being useful. The article states that this technology can recognize when a student is confused or bored. The problem with that is the fact that a person can fake emotions. If the students wanted to try to be funny they could mess with the system and change something that was working. In the article, Dr. Huang said, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective teacher."" An effective teacher wouldn't change something just because a couple people ar bored or confused. This system also doesn't factor in the chances of someone having a bad day. If someone is having a bad day confused emotions could already be happening before the lesson. This would mess everything up.

I understand that some people aren't natural psychologists, and don't know how to read emotions. These people can just take there time and teach themselves how to read them. Even though not all teachers have the knowledge learned through psychology, they all should. People naturally believe that technology can help. It can help, and thats why it is understandable to want the Facial Action Coding System to be used by school. There are better alternatives to this system. The author stated, ""we can write down simple instructions the ""encode"" different emotions."" If people can do that then, why aren't they doing it?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in school. It has no value to learning. The better alternative is to make teachers do things themselves. Teachers should learn how to read emotions. They also need to learn that you can't always rely on a system that is not flawless. A teachers job is to teach and not to sit and let technology run their classroom. So if schools want a type of technology that isn't valuable, they can use it all they want, but if they want something that has value they should teach their teachers how to read emotions.",5
